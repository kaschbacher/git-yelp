      "[[20609, 2.0, \"I had a lot of pain in my left leg, so I did some yelping, checked my medical plan, and made an appointment with Dr. Akizuki. The doctor spent as much time initially with me as seemed necessary. He didn't rush, and explained he thought I had a hip problem. I was to get an xrays and an MRI and call back.Once the MRI results were back, Dr. Akizuki and I began a game of phone tag. Finally in a voice mail message, he told me that my ankle was in pretty bad shape. We'd need an appointment to sort out what to do. It was a bit annoying to have to exchange two or three phone calls to get this information, and of course, I was a bit surprised that the diagnosis had changed from a hip problem to an ankle problem. In fact, I was sure a mix up had occurred. I made another appointment.Dr. Akizuki explained that yes it was a hip problem no explanation about the ankle message and that I was a bit young for hip replacement although he didn't rule that out. He said we could try cortisone to the hip which would require fluoroscopic needle guidance the hip joint is tricky to find unlike a knee. I guess Dr. A. had made a simple mistake the ankle call and still believed he was OK. We scheduled the procedure.The procedure went well. Dr. Akizuki was careful to explain everything he was doing and very careful to be sure I was comfortable and painless. He inserted some dye, found the joint, and gave me a shot of cortisone. All was fine.I had a good deal of pain that evening, but the doctor had warned of that. I took a vidodin left over from a wisdom tooth extraction, but the pain was gone the next day, and the hip worked pretty well.In the next few days, however, the inside of my leg got completely black and blue as if it had been terribly bruised. Yet, there was no pain. In fact it was a little numb. I didn't know if the discoloration was bruising or if it might be the dye. Fairly concerned as the discoloration worsened and spread over the next few days, I telephoned the doctor again and left a message about the problem. No response. I called again. Still no response. After a month of no response, I gave up. My final word is that I think Dr. Akizuki is a competent, maybe even skilled Orthopedist. But somehow we got into an impossibly poor communication loop. I believe that my time is as important as my doctor's time. I don't believe I should have to chase a doctor down to find out what's happening with my health once I've engaged the doctor. I've heard about some pretty cool hip replacement technology going on at UCSF, so I'm turning my energy to finding out about it, and choosing a different Orthopedist. Sorry Dr. A. Hope our experience was just an aberration.\"], [21304, 1.0, \"Dr Wolf is a true wolf in sheep's clothing. Do not be misled by all the plaques and other commendations he has hanging all over his office because unfortunately I was fooled and now I am paying the price.A few years ago I was referred to Dr Wolf for problems with my shoulder. At that time I was also scheduled for an arthroscopic procedure to have my right knee cleaned out by another surgeon at UCSF. Dr Wolf lied to me about the other doctor's imminent retirement he is still practicing and sweet talked me into having my knee procedure done by him.Prior to surgery he took no xrays or MRI nor did he ask to look at any ordered by previous doctors, and on the morning of the surgery before going into the operating room his assistant surgeon asked him what they were doing with my knee. In a very cavalier manner he told him it is just going to be a simple wash out of the jointPost op he never came to see me before I was sent home. In the next few days my knee swelled up terribly and I was taken back to his office. He did not even bother to see me instead asking his assistant to drain my knee of fluid. At that point I demanded to see him. When he finally saw me he seemed very upset and proceeded to drain my knee. He was very rough with the needle causing me a lot of pain. My knee had been drained for excess fluid on another occasion prior to surgery by another doctor so I know what it feels like to go through the procedure just not what this guy was doing to me!I demanded the pictures taken during the arthroscopic procedure and showed them to several other orthopedists. The pictures clearly showed that Dr wolf had completely scraped away the thin layer of cartilage I had left under my patella knee cap; none of the other orthopedic specialists could understand why he would do a thing like that. My knee was now bone on bone under the patella. I saw Dr wolf one more time to ask for an explanation. In his cavalier manner he told me in hind sight maybe he should not have scraped away the cartilage I had left under the patella but now that it was done he could do a partial knee replacement and it would make me feel great! I could not believe what I was hearing from this man. I left his office in despair and totally depressed.Now I live in a lot of pain and can not climb any stairs. I have had to have a stair lift installed in my house so I can access the upper floor. Every step I take I hear bone grinding on bone and it is very painful. I should have taken legal action against this doctor but I was just too depressed at that point. Every specialist I have seen has told me I am now going to need a knee replacement. I wish I had never met this man . He ruined my life! BEWARE!\"], [23355, 5.0, \"I took my son to Dr. Saxena following a ruptured achilles tendon. He is an elite level athlete with college opportunities slipping with every week off field. BUT walking the rest of his life without a limp is most important! I found Dr. Saxena confident in his diagnosis and matter of fact in his prognosis. It was in his bio online with Palo Alto Medical Foundation that he specialized in Achilles work. So though he was the only Dr. available for consult Friday morning, I believe he was the right doctor. He came in before his scheduled surgeries to meet with us. We raced to get there so we would not be the cause of a late doctor. He did not rush through his exam. He spoke to my son, directly! He understood that as a junior in high school he was lookng at college and asked which ones. I booked my son's surgery for the following Tuesday. As an anxious mom, I sought a second opinion from a highly regarded orthopedist. He was wonderful too. Nice. But no more conversational than Dr. Saxena. In the end, we opted for the surgeon that performs 34 of these operations per week rather than the one that does 34 every couple of months. The preop meeting left me totally confident in the hands to which we had placed our son.Our post op appt was today, Dr Saxena asked a little more about my son and continued to form a relationship. I believe that he is interested in my son and he is invested in his progression through this injury and healing process.I would recommend Dr. Saxena to patients who realize their injury will take more than one appointment to solve if they can get through it in one appt boy are you lucky! He is very interested in the healing process. I did my research based on his body of work, not my stressed out first meeting, although I left the office totally confident in my choice and really only sought a second opinion I could not answer questions that well meaning friends had asked. I understand the stress people are under when faced with physical challenges and would encourage you to do your research and select your medical care provider based on their experience, specialty and if you can discover it, their personal passion for the procedure you are about to undertake. By the way, I too feel it matters little what your feet look like as long as you can put one in front of the other! Scars are just another story to tell. Good luck if you are researching this, I know you need it.PSI really liked his assistant...she did everything I asked of her, changed pharmacy for prescriptions, sent attendance letter to son's school...did you ask anything of her? Or try to talk to her for any length of time? Slow down with the negativity people...\"]]\n"

      "[20802, 1.0, \"Do not let Dr. Jon Dickinson scope your hips. I have a long history with CPOSM and I won't delve into the hours wasted waiting in their lobby. My frustration lies solely with Dr. Dickinson. He scoped both my right and left hip and my right hip is now in much worse shape  from Day 1 post op  and my left hip saw no improvement. Recent MRI's on both hips clearly show a lot of carelessness on Dr. Dickinson's part  per his surgical peers, he didn't do a very thorough job on either hip.Dr. Dickinson was made the de facto hip arthropscopy surgeon in the office after Dr. Gilbert retired. So Dr. Dickinson does knees, shoulders and hips as well as spends time as the Oakland Athletics orthopedist. Knowledgeable surgeon, indeed, but he is so incredibly rushed both in failing to describe the risks associated with surgery and doing a thorough job in the maximum 90 minutes he allocates to your surgery. Hip surgeries inherently take longer due to the traction process, but Dr. Dickinson is so careless in what he does that he seems jaded in thinking followup surgeries are just part of the process. I now have second and third opinions from other hip surgeons who have seen before & after MRI's of my right hip, which is in constant pain. Both say Dr. Dickinson's questionable surgical actions to debride tearing tissue away from my right labrum without doing a thorough job removing osteophytes near the labrum have resulted in exposed nerves in the labrum. Those nerves are now being constantly irritated with pain and clicking in my hip that wasn't present before surgery. Both surgeons also say that I didn't even need the surgery in the first place, since I didn't have any pain in my right hip months leading up to the surgery. Dr Dickinson still, however, encouraged me to have surgery on it, since the MRI showed a torn labrum. He claimed that torn labrums will eventually lead to hip replacements, which has never been proven medically valid, and he failed to tell me that 23's of hip arhroscopy's leave the patient worse or the same, especially when it comes to labrum surgery which is so uncertain.As with everyone else on this board, Dr. Dickinson nonchalantly told me to give it a year with rehab, which I did. It has been over a year and a half, and my right hip has not improved since Day 1 post op  it has gotten worse. It was fine before surgery. I now live in NYC and Dr. Dickinson won't return my phone calls or respond to my letters asking for reimbursement for my outofpocket expenses for the surgery on my right hip. There is ZERO accountability from him or CPOSM when it comes to their actions, despite 2nd3rd opinions discrediting them. I even wrote to Dr. Callander Managing partner explaining my situation  nothing from him either, which is completely disrespectful. There is something seriously wrong with a surgeon when he shows less accountability after working on my body than an auto mechanic does after working on my car.\"]\n"

      "[21156, 5.0, \"I had a total hip replacement with Dr Callander last year on 129, so I'm over 1 year post op. Having the total hip completely changed my life! I'm only in my 40's but have had two hip surgeries prior to the total hip prior surgeries were not done by Dr. Callander. I was diagnosed with congenital hip dysplasia in my late 20's it was never diagnosed when I was younger. It's important to note that growing up I was extremely athletic  soccer, softball, track, etc. so to go from very active to literally not being able to walk normal in my late 20's was horrific. I visited several doctors before I was correctly diagnosed. My first surgery was around age 30 and because I was so young they opted NOT to do a total hip at that time and did a Periacetabular Osteotmy. This actually made my following years very difficult. In the end I don't think that was the right surgery for me, as it completely limited my range of motion and I still walked with an extremely pronounced limp, 1 year after that first surgery I had 2nd to remove excess bone growth after the Osteotmy, but again didn't bring much relief. I moved into my mid30's just living with what I was dealt, still active when I could be, but near the amount I was. I had 2 kids as well  but after my 1st child my hips became worse although during pregnancy they were great and after my 2nd child I pretty much immediately went back to CPMC. The doctor who performed my first 2 surgeries retired  and I loved him so I did my research and I found Dr. Callander. Every appointment Dr. Callander answered questions and he was realistic with managing my expectations. Because I had these prior surgeries my fearconcern was that I would have a total hip and see no change, that I would still have a severe limp, and pain. I went into surgery with the hope that at least the total hip would alleviate pain. Dr Callander also was very clear with me that he would try and fix the leg length discrepancy but he really wouldn't know more until he was in surgery. The prior surgery left me with 3 pen length screws holding things together. I woke up from surgery and from there it was an instant game changer  I could tell I was going to get my life back. I was up the same day w a walker and the PT therapists were great in hospital. I was discharged but had home care come for a few weeks, and then had outpatient therapy to build back strength in my hipleg. This is the part that is not easy so It's important you follow direction, take care of yourself, and push yourself hard during physical therapy. I literally was pain free after surgery and the best news was that Dr Callander was able to correct my leg length issues completely. I know not everyone has the same results but for me I feel like he saved me and I will forever be grateful. His staff, Mara, was amazing. I actually know at some point I'll need to have my other hip done, and I will absolutely see Dr Callander for that as well. Hands down  top notch surgeon!\"]\n"

      "Adding some more information. Another great thing about him is that he was willing to experiment with me for my fibromyalgia. I brought in a book by a specialist and he was willing to try the protocol. Many doctors would not do that. He won't do anything crazy but will consider something reasonable. He also made himself available when I was having an emergency severe toothearache. He was at an offsite seminar, but his receptionist asked him to call me and he did, prescribed something and I think he even checked in with me later on or I called back. Either way, I got the treatment I needed.For those who think it takes a while to get ahold of him or his receptionistplease keep in mind it is one doctor and one receptionist. As you can see from all of the 5 star reviews, he spends time with his patients. Be a little patient yourself and you will be soon benefit from his great treatment.\n"

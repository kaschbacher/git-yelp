INSERT INTO `review` VALUES (669,189,5,'Adding some more information. Another great thing about him is that he was willing to experiment with me for my fibromyalgia. I brought in a book by a specialist and he was willing to try the protocol. Many doctors would not do that. He won\'t do anything crazy but will consider something reasonable. He also made himself available when I was having an emergency severe toothearache. He was at an offsite seminar, but his receptionist asked him to call me and he did, prescribed something and I think he even checked in with me later on or I called back. Either way, I got the treatment I needed.For those who think it takes a while to get ahold of him or his receptionistplease keep in mind it is one doctor and one receptionist. As you can see from all of the 5 star reviews, he spends time with his patients. Be a little patient yourself and you will be soon benefit from his great treatment.'),(670,189,2,'It\'s tough to write this review, as I\'ve been a patient of Dr. Dan for at least 3 years now, if not more. I\'m a huge fan of his personally, he\'s always given me sound advice and has been easy to work with, until recently. He\'s lost his personal touch.The result of being one of the best rated doctors on Yelp when SF goes through a massive population increase is supply can no longer meet demand. It\'s now become incredibly tough to get an appointment to see him or get real oneonone care. As most people have complained, I understand why he\'s not taking new patients unless it\'s a serious illness given that he barely has time to see his existing patients. I did the same song and dance years ago to get in to see him. But at this point, I think he needs to stop taking new patients entirely.First frustration round: I went in for a physical in May, to which he ordered me a bunch of labs to check blood, cholesterol, etc. Except he failed to tell me which of the 2 labs I should go to before I left my appointment and his assistant never followed up to give me that information. Being busy with travel overseas and work, I forgot nor did I feel like I should have to be the one to call in and inquire about it.Second frustration round: Since May, the past 3 times I\'ve called for an appointment, I\'ve been unable to get in to see him in under a week  I\'ve gone instead to Urgent Care Centers for 2 out of those 3 times  one for food poisoning, another for a fairly severe viral infection because I couldn\'t wait 5 days to see him.Third frustration round: For that 3rd time, when I called to make an appointment after 5 weeks of persistent heartburn, he made an exception for me because I complained about being unable to get an appointment to his assistant. It took her 2 days, even still, to call me back and tell me that he would see me after hours at 4:45pm how that is after hours, when you open at 9am, no clue  doctor hours never cease to amaze me. I was told that it might be bacterial, having never had heartburn historically, and that test would tell him whether or not I should have medication or further assessment by a specialist. He ordered another set of labs, including the same ones that weren\'t originally processed from my physical and off I went to Quest. Fourth frustration round: The test results were delivered to me by his assistant on the phone. NOT by him, and she knew nothing about his commentary to me regarding meds or a specialist. It was a simple, it came back negative...with no solution. I asked her why he wasn\'t able to pick up the phone to call and speak with me directly, since he\'s the person familiar with my case. She said she\'d send him a message and let him know. I called just now this morning to check back and instead of him calling me, like I asked, she read verbatim a message he\'d typed her telling me to take my labs and go to see Dan Conlin, gastronomist. And when I asked again why he couldn\'t call me directly to discuss this, she said he\'s too busy to make calls to patients and he would be leaving for 3 weeks of vacation which has compounded that issue.Why is it that you have time, Dr. Dan, to text your assistant a lengthy message, but can\'t simply pick up a phone and dial me directly? And, if you can\'t call your patients directly with being too busy, why are you even bothering to take new clients still?I\'m going to One Medical for now on. You\'ve lost me as your patient.'),(671,189,5,'I\'ve been seeing Dr. Kalshan for 6 years now and he is fantastic. When it comes to medical care I want someone who knows their stuff, can translate medical jargon, geeks out on the WHY, asks direct questions, and somehow bundles that all up with the best bedside manner I\'ve experienced. It truly is wonderful to have a physician that you can speak honestly and earnestly with  who also has a great memory & systems for keeping all his notes and records about you for future visits. He is not covered by my insurance and I still go to see him.'),(672,189,5,'I am 62 years old and because of my jobs during those years have moved around a lot. My last job brought me from Southern California to San Francisco. Once again, I need to find a primary care physician and a friend recommended his; Dr. Kalshan. I couldn\'t have been more fortunate. From my very first visit to my 8th or 10th now, he has spent the time necessary to examine me, answer questions, and explain lab results or medications. I have never felt rush and he didn\'t park me in one waiting room to hop across 2 or 3 more before coming back  he stayed with me until we were through. Dr. Kalshan treatment recommendations have been excellent with only minor course corrections, were excellent. I have had to see a podiatrist and a surgeon and being new in town had no idea where to go and I was pleased to find his referral recommendations were equally excellent.Without hesitation I would, and have, recommend him to my family and friends as I know they will be treated well.'),(673,189,5,'Dr Kalshan is one of the best drs I\'ve ever seen. Surprisingly I only see him about once a yr for the past 8 yrs and he seems to remember so many of the things I\'ve told him. He\'s very personable and down to earth. Easy to joke with! I never have to wait in his lobby and there\'s no runaround like you have at big hospitals. Making appointments are easy!'),(674,189,1,'Was very impressed by the 4.5 star rating, and tried him out last year. Went in for my annual physicalwell woman exam, came away with nothing more than a creepedout vibe I\'ve worked with male physicians in the past. I\'m not trying to hate, but... just look at his photo on his website and draw your own conclusions for a first impression, a cursory examination of the mouthears and a quick blood pressure check. A few questions about my general health, how much I exercise, etc. Then he gave me a piece of paper with a list of tests Quest would need to run on me whenever I could make it over there for a blood culture, and that was it. I had been with Palo Alto Medical Foundation for years before, and I definitely didn\'t walk out after 10 minutes. Pretty sure no part of my examination with Dr. Kalshan was at all related to wellwoman issues.After a couple months, I called in to get a normal flu shot. None available. No referrals, no stocking or restocking? available. Asked again about what else is generally included in a physicalwellwoman exam, and the generally clueless ladies he has at reception offered no information and said he was unavailable for comment.Today at around 10am, got increasingly disturbing symptoms of a pretty serious UTI and called him to see if there was anything he could do, whether it was a quick over the phone triage or praxis and then prescribe me something, I could describe all my symptoms. or i could go in for a quick culture at Quest and then he could give me a Rx then. Lady at reception says, we\'re booked up until next week but I\'ll see what I can do. Doesn\'t call me back until 3:20pm. By that time I\'d gotten Palo Alto Medical Foundation on the line at least 5 times, gone through their amazingly efficient procedure 5 times, only because I wasam in pain and because the first time i called my symptoms weren\'t bad enough, gotten a prescription, driven and gotten my prescription and taken the first pill 2.5 hours ago.In short  don\'t count on this guy. He will let you down when you are most in need. I haven\'t gone through insurancenoninsurance issues with him, but it sounds like others have and perhaps you don\'t even want to start that relationship to begin with...'),(675,189,1,'I stand by my review. I\'m not a paidtohate Yelper. Maybe chubby wasn\'t the exact word he used, but I was put on the scale and told to start exercising more as I looked heavier than previous visits. Not surprising he couldn\'t find me in his records, as I haven\'t been there for a few years. Again, I went there for a throat infection, not weight loss advice. That, and the awful front desk service, made me drop him as a doctor. Also, haranguing me via the Messages option to try to get me to delete my review doesn\'t work. It\'s a free country and we have free speech, do we not? Isn\'t that what Yelp is for?As for Claudio O\'s comments, my experience is obviously different from hers  I am happy she had a great experience with him. I respect her opinion even if she doesn\'t respect mine.'),(676,189,5,'Every time I think to myself that I should forget schlepping all the way to the city to go to the Dr I now live in Redwood City, I go to Dr. Kalshan and remember why I keep hauling my ass up there in the first place. He never rushes me, he is always thorough, and he keeps up to date on what is happening in the medical field. I just went in for an eye infection and casually asked a question about a female medical issue that I didn\'t like the answer my OBGYN gave me. Not only did he actually listen to me, he had just read some new information about gene mutations that might be part of my problem. So now I am on some simple OTC remedies to see if that alleviates my issue. Something, I might add, that I have talked to my gyno 3 times about with no solution. I have yet to go with any ailment that he hasn\'t quickly recognized and remedied for me. I will definitely be a lifelong patient!'),(677,189,5,'Dr. Kalshan is THE best! I was extremely lucky to stumble upon his name in the long list of doctors within my insurance network. He\'s been my doctor ever since I first moved to SF roughly 10 years ago. I just cant see anyone else! He\'s super down to earth, young, funny, kind, honest and great at what he does. He makes you feel extremely comfortable, like you\'re talking to a friend, not your General Practitioner. I have a short list of amazing people I would love to grab a beer with which includes Alec Baldwin, Will Ferrell, Andy Samberg and Dan Kalshan. If he can make you laugh while treating your strep throat, you know he\'s hilarious and a tad bit sarcastic under that white coat. I\'ve referred all my friends and coworkers, we all love Dr. Kalshan!'),(678,189,5,'I\'ve been going to Dr. Kalshan since he started his practice 1213 years ago. I literally think I was one of his first patients when he took over his practice. Naturally he was less busy when he first started, but I\'ve noticed no change in his attentiveness or level of care even though he\'s much more busy now.I hold Dr. Kalshan in very high regard. I trust him completely and have been recommending him to everyone in my company who will listen to me. I wouldn\'t be surprised if 25% of my company now sees him and I\'ve yet to hear anyone say one bad thing about him.I\'ve moved states a few times over the 12+ years of going to Kalshan. While living out of state it\'s required me to to see different doctors. Not one of them was good as Dan. Seriously. A few times I\'ve seen a specialist before going to Dr. Kalshan. Two of those times Dan actually ended up helping me faster and giving better care than a specialist. Another reason I trust him so much.He\'s had a wide variety of staff help over the years. After reading other reviews, it seems to be the most discussed part of his practice. I\'ve always try my best to be as friendly with his staff as I know they have an incredibly busy and stressful job. In return, I\'ve always found his staff to be great to deal with and very pleasant. If you treat them well, they will absolutely return the respect.'),(679,189,1,'Dr. Kalshan has gone all Obamacare on me. Suddenly, the health insurance policy that I\'ve been using since 2011 is no longer acceptable in his office. Rather than trying to find new insurance hard, I\'m going to find a new doctor easy.'),(680,189,5,'I was prompted to write a review because of reading Mi M.\'s review. Sorry Mi M, you must be mistaken.I have been going to Dr. Kalshan for almost 10 years now. He has always been caring and patient. He is very knowledgable and communicates that well. It is rare to find a doctor you feel comfortable with and trust. Not to mention, always has the best smile on his face making me forget why I came in, in the first place. :I have recommended him along the way and everyone I have ever recommended him to, love him. I could not boast more about him!!!'),(681,189,5,'Dan is the MAN! I feel totally comfortable around him and he\'s just a very trustworthy guy.Warning: Friends joke coming up... I didn\'t want to end up like Ross with an old pediatrician my whole life, so once I moved to the city I did some research and heard nothing but great things, so I made an appointment.Dan and I can joke with each other, but be serious when we need to beespecially when it comes to my health.It does take a while for them to get you into the system for your first appointment, but someone bailed, and they called me up right away and I was in about two weeks after I called.I recommend Dan to all my friends, and would advise anyone else looking for a great doctor to make an appointment with him.'),(682,189,5,'First off, I\'ve been a patient of Dr Kalshan for about 8 years. I like him a lot, and he has always provided excellent medical advice. Admittedly I haven\'t had a lot of problems, or been that difficult to diagnose, but he has a great manner and is very knowledgeable.Secondly, most of the reviews for Dr Dan are either a 5star or a 1star, with the vast majority being 5star reviews. As far as I can see, many of the 1star reviews are not about him, but are about his staff, or his billing. Whilst he used to have a mediocre receptionist but not as bad as some people say, his current receptionist is GREAT  friendly, communicative and quick to answer the phone. I\'ve never had any problems with billing, although others might have.Obviously some people have had bad experiences, but it appears that many most of them have been in the past.I would thoroughly recommend Dr Kalshan.'),(683,189,5,'A terrific PCP.

I called Tuesday and after much going back and forth finally got an appt for this week. His assistant, who has a terrible phone manner, called me 30 minutes before my appointment at 4:15 on a Thursday to say he longer accepts Blue Cross EPO, so would not accept my insurance. Now, I understand not accepting an HMO or telling a patient from the get go that they do no accept your insurance, but I told them who I was when I called earlier this week to make the appointment, and they waited until I was literally about to leave to call me to tell me they no longer accept my insurance. Had i known Tuesday I would have gone to another Dr. The assistant tried to tell me they were not able to accept it, but as an independent Doctor, it is his choice what insurance he accepts and to suddnenly no longer accept a major carrier It is a Dr\'s choice to optout confirmed by BCBS. Shame on him for not letting me know in advance. Now I have to go away with no medicine all I need is antibiotics at 4:30 pm on a Thurday and i go out of town tomorrow. My insurance does not cover any out of network Doctors so this really put me in a bind.

Wish all Drs were as knowledgable and open minded as him!'),(691,189,5,'This man is incredible. Lucky enough to have only had a few visits to Dr. Kalshan\'s office for minor ailments, I\'ve left completely satisfied with his care every time.No matter what I ask, Dan is always eager to discuss it.

The woman who answered the phone told me he is not accepting appointments from new patients, but if I happened to have something wrong cold, back pain then he could see me.  Almost to the point of suggesting I should create an ailment!This is a disgrace.  First off, how does an MD expect to develop a relationship if they don\'t do the intro physical?  Secondly, this is a clear message that he only values higherend visits where he can charge more.  This provides little comfort that he will not always be searching for the upcharge during any visit.  I guess this is consistent with other reviews suggesting he is quick to prescribe meds.'),(693,189,5,'Insightful kind doc; Best I have found in SF; Not your Mom\'s GP.'),(694,189,5,'Dr. Kalshan is the best!

If I need medicine he also seems to know just the thing. Sinus infection, check. Bronchitis, check. Allergies, check. My shoulder hurts, check! He also has a million specialists to whom he can refer you should you need additional care.I recently traveled to Mexico and was misdiagnosed with a foodborne illness while there. When I returned to the states I followedup with him and as my primary care physician he took a quick survey of my symptoms and diagnosed me with the correct issue. What a relief! No more Meximeds, pain relief for my uncomfortable issue ruptured ovarian cyst, and peace of mind.Dr. Kalshan is educated and helpful.

I\'ve NEVER had a doctor do that before. They instead forced me to file my own claim to make the insurance company pay me. The form they gave me apparently didn\'t have all the information the insurance company needed to pay on the claim and 5 months later I still haven\'t been able to get Kalshan\'s office to settle the case with the insurance company.Only go to this doctor if you like your billing to be a gigantic pain in the ass.Edit: Also I want to point out I have a PPO plan. Also his receptionists never return your calls even though they say they will.'),(697,189,5,'Dr. Kalshan is an amazing doctor, and I recommend seeing him if you are in need of a Doctor downtown.

In the end, he is an amazing doctor.'),(698,189,3,'Dr. Kalshan himself is great, but let\'s take a little time to talk about his incompetent staff.

Nice. The flipside is that appointments for physicals have more waiting time since those are longer an hour. They used to only accept cash, but last time I went I was able to pay by credit, which is nice, since I don\'t have to remember to hit the ATM before I go anymore.Dr. Kalshan is patient and looks you in the eye when you speak to him. Might be a strange thing to point but I can\'t tell you how many other doctors I\'ve been to who don\'t do this. Kinda makes you feel like they aren\'t listening. I\'ve even gone into doctors where they have completely ignored what I came in for to do other things. But Dr. Kalshan does, and treats you with respect.Just because he\'s young and speaks in plain english doesn\'t make him the hipster doctor.

Dr. Kalshan used to have a great bedside manner and was effective. As the years went by I noticed two things. First, he became rushed and unnecessarily prescribed meds for simple issues rather than taking time to listen. Second, his already bad staff got progressively worse. I had an emergency situation and he didn\'t call me back  he didn\'t get the message because his office voicemail doesn\'t accept calls from cell phones huh?!. I talked to him afterwards about it and he said that would get fixed. I had another serious situation and didn\'t get called back left a message with the receptionist and a voicemail.

Not sure why it\'s that hard to keep someone, but it seems to be, so there. Scheduling an appointment is sometimes difficult. If you\'re sick, and you want to come in today or tomorrow, it\'s probably not going to happen. Plan to be sick a week or more in advance, so scheduling won\'t become an issue, and you\'re set.

I still follow his recommendations and find that on the the lists of family care physicians in the City, he is among the best. Yet, keep in mind that like all doctors and medical centers these days, you need to find out in advance if your health care provider will cover his fees. Patients must pay for each visit and sign an agreement of payment before scheduling an appointment. At my last appointment with Dr. PenaDolhun his office was billing insurance as a nonsubscriber. That means that you the patient must pay out of network rates. Most health insurance carriers like Blue Shield will not give patients the best rate if they select a doctor outside of their subscriber network. Patients should be able to go to the doctor of their choice. Yet unfortunately as it is now, even the PPO level of health insurance coverage puts limits on what they cover and discourage patients from going to a doctor out of their network. This is why Dr. PenaDolhun\'s office told me about Health Savings Account Plans. HSA\'s are becoming more common now and I hope the idea improves, especially as more and more people are paying for health services out of pocket these days. To learn more about HSA\'s contact your health insurance carrier. So far I think US Bank is the best bank around that knows what HSA\'s are all about.

Its like an alternative spin on doctors without borders,...doctors without limitations. For all the ways I\'ve ever been told no, its not done that way, sorry, we can\'t help.... Dr. Dolhun has an answer, a solution, an option. I yelped my way into his office quite blindly, going off little more than proximity and availability. From the moment I walked in to their modern, clean and impressively green  everything is electronic, a doctor who emails and gasp, texts! office, I was wildly impressed. Just as the delightful intern checked me in, Dr. Dolhun stepped into the waiting room to introduce himself and assure me he would be ready for me as soon as Meagan finished entering the new patient intake.  True to his word, I walked straight from the check in counter to his study no outdated magazine flipping boredom for this girl!. For the next 45 minutes or so, he took the time to get to know me, took copious notes on his laptop, engaged me in some problem solving and outlined the next steps. Only then, did Meagan return to bring me to a medical room and check the usual vitals. Dr. Dolhun promptly followed in her footsteps and just like that, the three of us were back to the reception desk to tackle finding a pharmacy that carried a rare generic version of a very expensive $375 prescription. In all the years I\'d been taking the medication, I hadn\'t known a generic even existed! I don\'t have health insurance... so when the sixth pharmacy he called personally replied in the affirmative and confirmed it would cost only $26, I left his office smiling EAR to EAR. Because of his perseverance and diligence, he literally saved me upwards of $4000 a year! Additionally, he wrote the script for 3 refills and thus alleviating the financial stress of a monthly office visit. So much gratitude for this man! I\'ve never had a doctor truly feel like so much of an ally. It was so incredibly refreshing to visit a doctor\'s office that just felt so free of the usual red tapebureaucracy.

For example, he told me that he would call me back with some results by the end of the week and not only did he not do so, but I had to call and leave several messages until his staff finally called me back with the results. No apology or anything! When I asked them the reason for the delay, they told me they weren\'t sure and that Dr. Dolhun would call me back with an explanation, which he never did. Sure, during your initial visit, Dr. Dolhun makes you feel like he is the best doctor you can ask for, but once you actually become a regular, the level of courtesy you are shown goes waaaaay down. Additionally, I don\'t think it is professional for a doctor to talk up his office assistants when they are present and then complain about them to a patient when they make a mistake.

Wicked smart too.I\'d say the best thing is that you can actually get an appointment with him in a reasonable amount of time  I waited 2ish weeks for a new patient and 2 days for a regular appointment.

Then I met Dr. Shu.Dr. Shu is definitely one the dying breed of doctors, that actually cares for his patient\'s well being and health. He addresses all of my concerns and answers any questions I have in a polite and sincere manner. In no way did I feel rushed. He even contacted me to follow up on my health condition a week later!

I have since moved, and still value his advice on medical conditions!'),(788,192,5,'Over the last six years or so, I\'ve called on Dr. Shu for advice and treatment. From my silliest calls asking for an appointment because I think I have a brain tumor bump on head, to more serious symptoms that needed his expertise and prescriptions, he\'s been my goto doctor in San Francisco. And from silly to serious, he\'s always been patient and given it top consideration, or so I felt.I loathe going into a big hospital and basically playing a lottery to find a good GP. I don\'t like people easily enough to do that. I prefer a private practice and don\'t want someone too young or too old. So when I first moved into the city, I needed to be really selective about which doctor would become MY doctor. He needed to have an excellent reputation, have a wealth of patience and a good sense of humor because I really will drop by if I think I have a brain tumor or if I\'m convinced I\'m losing too much hair, haha, and be very focused on details. Dr. Shu fit the bill perfectly and I fervently recommend him for your family doctor and GP. Be it kids or adults, he always has a smile for you and will get to the core of whatever ails you without making you feel rushed or ignored.This much, I know.'),(789,192,5,'I\'ve always struggled with finding good local GPs. Some come highly recommended but are impossible to book an appointment with and give you short shrift when you finally see them. It is not difficult to get an appointment with Dr. Shu and he is really exceptionally competent. I am worried that he will be discovered and then be overbooked but thankfully that is not the case yet but I\'ve no doubt he will become more popular with time so get in while you can!Dr. Shu has a great manner and makes time to understand your concerns. He has been my doctor for about 3 years and has given me good advice about how to improve my health and arranged a short notice colonoscopy with another doctor which was a wise precaution. All clear, thank goodness!I wish I had discovered him sooner and of course, he has my top recommendation.'),(790,192,5,'I started seeing Dr. Shu probably around 3 12 years ago for an issue that popped up in my elbow. Like a lot of guys in their 20\'s, I hadn\'t seen a doctor in almost a decade. It just never occurred to me. I called around to a few places, and luckily, Dr. Shu was able to see me that day.Since that first meeting, Dr. Shu & I have established a very positive doctorpatient relationship. He\'s helped me find specialists who have helped me diagnose health issues that I\'m happy to have figured out at a young enough age to be able to do something about them. His staff is courteous and helpful, both on the phone and in the office. The thing I really appreciate about Dr. Shu is that he has a conversation with you. He listens and allows you to bounce ideas off of him. I\'m the type of guy who does research, or at least attempts to, before going in to see the doctor. He\'s upfront with what\'s true and what\'s nonsense, as far as what I\'m reading on the internet. He lets you get your words out without interrupting you, and you can tell he knows what he\'s talking about. And if he\'s not completely familiar with something, he\'s not afraid to get on his computer and refamiliarize himself on the issue. This, to me, is much better than somebody maintaining that they know anything and everything in their given field. Dr. Shu is a smart doctor. He listens to you, and creates and ongoing dialog concerning health issues you have. He makes sure to talk to you in a way that makes things make sense. And he\'s available in a timely manner. I highly recommend him as your general practitioner. You can tell he cares about what he does.'),(791,192,5,'I\'ve got to give five stars to Dr. Shu. After years of not going to the doctor I had visited one of the local doctors who has an office a couple of blocks away from Dr. Shu. I would have to say that the experience was quite bad and therefore I turned to yelp to find my answer. That answer was Dr. Shu.He is a great doctor who cares about his patients. He always asks if I have any other questions or concerns. This was something new to me as my previous doctor never asked. It always felt as if he was rushing to get out of the office. This is the complete opposite with Dr. Shu. On my last visit we spent half an hour just catching up as well as talking about my physical and what I needed to do to stay healthy. I would highly recommend anyone to Dr. Shu if you\'re looking for a great doctor with a great bedside manner and someone we can talk to easily and not be afraid to ask questions.'),(792,192,5,'What is up with all the haters?Dr. Shu is consistently attentive to my questions and needs.

He is attentive and proactive in suggestions.His office has also implemented a secure internet based personal info system to look up my info. This is a godsend because I compare my stats from year to year seeking to live a long and healthy life.He even plays badminton with me! He is an intermediate player that puts up with my mess ups. He calls the shots fairly in or out, and he is a gentlemen and fair player on the court as well as in his practice. I always can discern a good person on how they handle their honest calls in sports such as golf, tennis, badminton and life.

I went in to see about an infection. It pretty much cleared up the day I was going in, but decided to go in anyway just to make sure. I saw the doctor and he seemed a little awkward, I felt I was the one putting him at ease. The doctor looked at me and said what he thought it was, but that it was pretty much cleared up. All this took under 5 minutes. He seemed nice but awkward.The one star is for the bill I got in the mail. $250 for less than 5 minutes of his time, no blood work, no prescription, and when I told the doctor that I also wanted to get a physical that day he said I would need to make another appointment to suck as much $ out of my pockets as possible?.

It\'s not always typical nowadays to get a PCP who one feels comfortable speaking with. As for the staff, only two of the doctor\'s assistants were kind to my mother. The rest such as the lady who sits at the window to collect payments gives an attitude that the patient is a bother as they are never friendly nor show appreciation.

I called in to see if I could come down that same afternoon thinking they would probably have to schedule an appointment sometime next week They were booked solid ut still managed to squeeze me in....so far so good.Upon arriving I was skeptical, as my previous experiences with doctors could be summed up with this; lack of timecare. Most doctor\'s honestly just assume and are quick to prescribe you your medication just to get you out of the office. Dr.Shu was different in this aspect. He thoroughly examined me of my condition and then explained his thoughts on what the causes were. I was there roughly for about 20 mins give or take.

He is also efficient without being rushed and answers all of your questions until you are satisfied. My favorite part of this visit was when Dr. Shu looked at my old records from my old doctor and pointed out an unusual result. While it wasn\'t super alarming, he told me that I could check it again with my regular blood work. I really like a doctor who will tell me what he sees and what he thinks, but let me make my own decision about whether I should care about it or not. My old doctor didn\'t do that because he decided for me to ignore these test results, but there\'s no way for anyone else to know what I value in my healthtime, so I\'m glad that Dr. Shu is patient enough to explain things to me so I can consider them for myself!

On top of that, he CAME TO ME. In my house?! Like one of those old 50s sitcoms?! Just unbelievable this service exist.That said, like most things in the world, you will need a little money.

I\'d been planning my outfit for weeks. My false lashes were framed by impeccably applied makeup. I\'d even sported my dancing shoes for the occasion.

I called a number of places and I could tell by many of the jaded receptionists answering my inquiries  that they were not the right place for me. The House Doctor was different though.

The moment I entered his warm unassuming practice  he got me a bottled water. The visit was smooth and I felt totally comfortable throughout it. He immediately ran a test there and then  and said that for precautionary measures they would run further tests at a lab. Probably one of the best aspects of the visit is that he was even able to prescribe and give me medicine until I was able to make it over to my regular doctor and pharmacy.A visit to The House Doctor isn\'t exactly cheap, but they will work with your insurance company after your appointment and more often than not  nearly 80 percent of the visit gets covered by insurance. Plus  as I\'ve realized in life  you can\'t put a price on good health and peace of mind. After my appointment  the doctor even followed back up with me to see how I was feeling.In a matter of a day or two I was feeling nearly 100 percent and after a quick visit to my normal doctor  they were in full agreement that The House Doctor definitely knew what he was doing.

After numerous doctors telling us nothing was wrong or that there was nothing that they could do, Dr. Davis took an hour and a half to listen attentively and prescribe a homeopathic and traditional medicine regiment and he even gave us a discount.We went back in for a check up and again received very kind, helpful and professional medical advise and a groovy vitamin shot to the bum. Dr. Davis is awesome! He\'s so cool I overlook the fact that I have to crawl through his tiny front door with my huge 6\'5\'\' frame. He even has a nice big flat screen tv in the waiting area, so you can have a friend drive you to see him when you\'re sick and not feel bad about them being bored while waiting. Oh and don\'t forget the free candy and water. Ginger chews by the ginger people! This place awesome.

Not only that but you have to pick doctors at random without knowing anything about them or their practices. Not my idea of care.So of course I turned to Yelp. You never fail me, Yelp. You led me to The House Doctor and he not only saw me 2 hours after I called, he also assured me I don\'t have the H1N1 so I can go back to work and he also gave me extremely informative, helpful medical advice to help me heal.Not only was he helpful, but he didn\'t throw me out or look terribly annoyed when I wouldn\'t shut up with my nonstop questions about natural alternatives to things like antibiotics which for me, cause more problems than they cure.Best of all, they provide a service to mail a claim form to your insurance company if you have one to recuperate the fees you pay. No paperwork for me for an out of network doctor! That alone is worth 5 stars.Would definitely go back and would refer a loved one without hesitation. He was very honest, upfront, open minded, no BS.

In fact, it\'s hard to believe that service like his even exists in this world of sicko managed care. Whenever I call Dr. Davis, I get care right away, and in his lovely home office. He\'s extremely easy to talk to, and it\'s obvious that he really cares. I love that he follows up with insurance afterward so that I don\'t have to deal with the medial bureaucrazy, which typically makes any medical condition worse because it is inevitably so stressful and infuriating. I also like that Dr. Davis has natural remedies in addition to typical treatments like antibiotics. I can\'t say emphatically enough how lucky I feel to have found him. When I\'m really sick, I turn to him first. One time, when I was literally immobilized with a high fever and strep throat that made me unable to swallow, he was on paternity leave, and his office referred me immediately to another doctor that made a house call and saved me from the trauma of visiting the emergency room.For personalized, attentive and effective medical care, The House Doctor is always the way to go!'),(846,193,5,'I\'ve never experienced a doctor\'s appointment like this before.

First, when we arrived at his office he was standing there ready and waiting. He has a great bedside manner, seemed very capable and considerate and really took his time with us. When we left, he helped us with my stroller up the stairs and waited at the door until we were safely in our car. I\'m used to going to hospitals to see doctors whose actions indicate that their time is much more valuable than mine. This is definitely no ordinary doctor. My son had a similar procedure at the ER last year...and the cost of going to the House Doctor was about 20% of the ER price under my crappy HRA plan.

I was coughing up the unimaginable and my throat felt like I was swallowing swords. They diagnosed me with the flu and said it would need to run it\'s course. By the following weekend, I was 200% worse and had no voice. I knew it was not just the flu, and didn\'t want to deal with being misdiagnosed again by Urgent Care. My friend recommended me to The House Doctor, who he had just seen regarding his illness. I picked up the phone and called.Dr. Davis was very flexible with his schedule and was able to either make a house call within hours or see me at his office in Potrero Hill. We settled on meeting at his office that evening, and upon arriving I was escorted into his office and was greeted by his large and friendly and soft and fluffy poodle Bijoux, who is also a therapy dog. He made me feel very comfortable by offering me bottled water Fuji, nonetheless! while I filled out some information.  While being seen, Dr. Davis was professional, relaxed, knowledgeable, and extremely kind and warm. His office and exam room were immaculate, well decorated, and inviting. After surveying my symptoms, he prescribed me the antibiotics that I badly needed after 10 days of what was not the flu. He submitted my prescriptions for me, for easy and convenient pickup, and also submitted the paperwork to my insurance company so I would not have to deal with the hassles of calling them to be reimbursed. Dr. Davis is flexible with his schedule. He can see you quickly after hours, and you never have to deal with waiting for appointments or dragging yourself to the doctor because he can come to you. His compassionate and friendly demeanor make visiting him a pleasure. That being said, from here on out I will call Dr. Davis any time I need a doctor.'),(850,193,5,'The previous reviews about Dr. Davis are all correct...really no need to repeat what others have said, but here is my experience.Living in Potrero Hill, there are 2 Urgent Care facilities within one mile from my place that were both closed on the weekend. I could have gone to UCSF, but it is clear over on the other side of town and would have rather not been stuck waiting for hours on end to get some help for the precarious situation I was in on a Saturday morning.I called The House Doctor and got the answering machine. I had a return call within 2 minutes from his receptionist and scheduled an appointment for later that morning. Dr. Davis was out on a house call at that moment, but he called me before coming in to help diagnose over the phone prior to the office visit. I have never had a doctor be proactive like that before.I had a painful visit...medically speaking that is, but Dr. Davis had the skills to remedy my situation quickly and hooked me up with the prescription to make it all better.A few days later Dr. Davis gave me a call to check up on things with a follow up appointment to see how I was healing and again he impressed me with his follow up.

Dr. Davis is truly amazing. I wasn\'t feeling tip top and just could not figure out what the heck was going on with me. So, a friend suggested I pop into Dr. Davis. Long story short here I went in and was highly impressed from the get go. Dr. Davis took the time to listen, learn and question what was going on. He is not one of those Docs who checks in and out in 3 12 minutes then tells you whats wrong with you. He takes the time and makes you feel like you should.

Not sure if this was only in the case of a same day urgent request, or if it is general policy.Controlled substance medications: Office visits were more expensive and there was a special fee for prescriptions if controlled substances were being prescribed. Good to know if you are being treated for pain management! Dr. Davis seems very knowledgeable about pain management, more so even than my surgeon\'s office! I had not experienced a doctor charging extra for this kind of visit before and was surprised. It is still probably less expensive to see him than to go to a specialist at a pain clinic. Dr. Davis and I had a constructive conversation about the reason for these fees, and I understand the reasons for them. However, if you are paying out of pocket for medical care and need pain management, it is a significant expense you will probably not find at most general practitioners offices. If you have insurance or if money is not an issue for you, however, why not go for the best possible care! I found him very compassionate and responsible in treating my pain after surgery, and also in managing my withdrawal symptoms from painkillers after I recovered from surgery. He was far more knowledgeable about treating my withdrawal symptoms than my surgeons office and saved me much suffering. For me it was expensive but worth every penny.Regular services outside of pain management were reasonably priced. The lowest fees are for visits to his office during regular business hours. Evenings, weekends, and homevisits are more expensive, and visits for pain management or other controlled substances are also more expensive.Bottom line: Dr. Davis is a fantastic doctor. I highly recommend him if the services you need from him are in your budget!'),(853,193,5,'I probably need to slow down on these instant reviews  but I must say that I had a great experience tonight meeting with Dr. Davis. I have a membership at Noe Valley Clinic so I was able to communicate with my regular doctor over the holiday weekend, but she could only speak to me on the phone and couldn\'t see me. Unfortunately there is only so much you can diagnose over the phone  so as it turned out, I needed to go to urgent care immediately. The thought of going to the ER made my stomach turn  waiting hours and hours in an uncomfortable waiting room, exposing myself to bubonic plague...the possibilities were endless.Luckily I remembered reading about urgent care clinics and oncall doctors on Yelp before  so I did a search and found another urgent care clinic. I called them and left a message  and luckily they were out so apparently they forwarded my message to Dr. Davis. As luck would have it, his office is very close to my apartment  literally only a few blocks away. He fit me in within 30 minutes of my call, which was awesome.You can read the other reviews for descriptions of the office, his receptionist apparently his wife as well  a very pleasant woman etc. All of the reviews are true  I never felt rushed, the fees are reasonable and everything was very pleasant and very convenient. I\'m sure that it was the exact polar opposite of what my experience would have been if I had gone to SF General. It\'s sad, but there is a huge healthcare divide in this city  and I\'m so, so lucky to be on the good side. That all said, Dr. Davis\' fees are probably less than what you would pay if you were uninsured at the ER, I\'m guessing. The other thing that *totally* made it worth it was that he also dispenses medication for his patients  he sent me away with everything I needed. That means: no schlepping off to the allnight pharmacy and waiting for god knows how long  so convenient!I\'m really happy that I found Dr. Davis, and I think that I will take his advice of opening an HSA  could use it for situations like these.

About two years ago, I came to her with sinus issues that had plagued me for well over a decade. Visits to other doctors and surgeons, including the Mayo Clinic, never provided anything other than temporary relief. 3 doctors, 2 surgeons, 2 surgeries Dr. Yeung was the first I felt was truly invested in figuring out what was wrong, and reasoning out a proper treatment.

And she\'s writing said review in 2011? What a load of crap that is. First off, what is a copay? $20? Is that really what it takes to vilify someone\'s professional service? Talk about unprofessional and lame. Hey Elizabeth: How about calling your bank for your records if the $20 means so much to you, and then try getting over yourself because you\'ve never made a mistake before. You\'ve been served.2 What elizabeth h says actually has a nugget of truth in it. I too have had some accounting problems. Once, I distinctly remember paying my copay in cash. I had the receipt, left it on my counter like I do for a while...and then threw it out or so I remember, right?. Later I was billed for the same $20. So now I *always* pay with a credit card...so if I need to go back and check my records its a piece of cake. A minor ding for their business process not being 100%...or maybe my and Elizabeth\'s memory sucks. YMMV.'),(883,194,5,'My appointment was on time and Dr. Yeung really impressed me so much that I am motivated to write a review and give her five stars.'),(884,194,1,'I really hate leaving this comments since she has a steller review but I have to put down an honest opinion here. Otherwise, it will mislead other people. I showed up exactly on time and even filled the paperwork ahead of time so I wouldn\'t have to wait. Still, I waited 20 minutes. Then, was showed to a room. Then, waited another 1520 minutes. Dr. Yeung finally showed up and said, I\'ll be right back. She was pregnant so I thought perhaps she needed to go to a bathroom or something. After 10 minutes when she didn\'t show up, I opened the door to ask the front desk where she went. It turned out she was seeing another patient while I was waiting. My time is just as important as yours. Why would you pop your head in and say, you\'ll be right back then, go see another patient?I walked right out promptly and never looked back. I made every effort to be there on time. The least they can do is to see me on time, perhaps 510 minutes late is normal but 40 minutes later??? Never again.'),(885,194,5,'Dr Yeung is one of my favorite doctors of all time. I went to her for a second opinion last year before having surgery on my sinuses and deviated septum and ended up having her do the surgery instead of my original doctor. Her office is very efficient and well run and confirms everything in great detail via email. Dr Yeung is very smart and knowledgeable and has excellent bedside manner. She explains everything in great detail and is, in her own words, conservative in terms of the treatments that she recommends. I did end up needing surgery and she did a great job with the surgical procedure as well.I recommend Dr Yeung highly whenever any friends or coworkers are looking for an ENT.'),(886,194,5,'I have to echo other sentiments here by saying that Dr. Yeung is one of the best doctors I have ever had. She doesn\'t make any extreme comments, she has a very personable and downtoearth bedside manner, she doesn\'t make offthecuff diagnoses, and she takes the least invasive route first. She is experienced. I went to her first for a sinus issue I had a couple of years ago, and more recently after a head trauma that resulted in a case of vertigo it\'s an inner ear issue in case you don\'t know, I went to her to see what could be done about it. After my office visit, the vertigo was gone! I felt that she was realistic in telling me that doing things like yoga could possibly bring it back, but I feel so much better knowing I know someone who can fix it. I would highly recommend her for any ear, nose and throat issues you might have.'),(887,194,5,'I was referred to a ENT doctor and I checked on yelp for who had some excellent reviews. Dr. Yeung was at the top of the list and was also in my network. I called her office and told the receptionist my symptoms. She asked for a formal referral. As soon as the referral was received I was called immediately. I was given an appointment the following morning.Dr. Yeung was engaged with my situation from the beginning. She was sincerely concerned and asked all the right questions to assess the problem. After a thorough examination, she recommended a CT scan, had her office seek approval from my insurance, and squeezed me into an early morning appointment the next day. I spent an hour at the next appointment, she took her time and referred me to another specialist. I wish all doctor experiences were like this one.'),(888,194,1,'This review is for the billingaccounting dept.

It is so hard to find not only a great doctor but a doctor that actually cares about you. I had a horrendous ear infection and after going to the ER then a medic clinic both dismissed it as swimmer\'s ear even though I hadn\'t swam in months, I went to Dr Yeung. She diagnosed me immediately and started me on different meds. She tried to perform a small procedure on my ear and when that was too excruciatingly painful to finish...she stopped. She didn\'t pull that doctor bs okay hold on for just one minute..... She stopped. She legitimately felt bad that I was in so much pain and she actually cared. I was dumbfounded. She even called me regularly to check up on me. Dr Yeung saw the real problem with my ear and got me on the right meds. Thank you Dr Yeung!!'),(892,194,1,'Showed up on time for my appointment. Had to wait 30 minutes to get into the room. Waited another 40 minutes till the doctor actually came in to see me. There was no one in the waiting room so being busy can\'t even be an excuse! The biggest waste of time ever...'),(893,194,5,'Bottom Line: Dr. Yeung is the gold standard for surgeons. Enough said. Background:Full disclosure  this review is by Brandi B\'s husband, Steve. This review documents my experience with Dr. Andrea Yeung and her practice at San Francisco Otolaryngology. Dr. Yeung performed an elective tonsillectomy on me at age 35.Initial Consult Experience:For years, I\'ve known something was not right with my ENT health, and my tonsils were suspect #1. I rarely see doctors. The few doctors I have seen prior somehow missed the clues to problems with my tonsils. One night I decided was enough was enough with these ongoing problems in my tonsils, cervical lymph nodes, and ears.  I decided to find an ENT to discuss my concerns. I choose Dr. Yeung as the first ENT to visit based on positive feedback here on Yelp. Hey, I trust the opinions of actual patients over golfing buddy recommendations from other doctors or lowest bidder recommendations from insurance.During a very thorough hourlong initial consult, Dr. Yeung attentively listened to my concerns. Unfortunately, I was getting over bronchitis on the day of my initial consult. An urgent care clinic had proscribed a 5 day ZPac, so my usual symptoms were mostly gone.  Dr. Yeung could have easily dismissed me as being a hypochondriac, given my tonsils and lymph nodes were very small after 5 days on a ZPac. Nevertheless, Dr. Yeung listened and actively interviewed me to determine that the tonsils were possible candidates for removal. Based on her observations and interviews, she validated there was a real issue here. Admirably, Dr. Yeung makes it very clear that tonsillectomy in adults is no joke. She admitted that a surgeon will naturally gravitate toward surgical intervention. Yet, she offered other nonsurgical solutions for him to regularly debreed the tonsil crypts. She made it very clear that the recovery would not be easy, and the results would be likely worthwhile but not totally life changing. Her honesty and transparency were key factors in our decision to have the surgery. Ultimately, my wife and I felt inflammation on a chronic basis was not healthy, and we had confidence in Dr. Yeung after spending an hour with her.Also of note, Dr. Yeung extracted a hardened cast of earwax from my right ear that may have taken years to accumulate. Amazingly, other doctors never mentioned the fact that his right ear could not be visualized. The sensation of being able to hear again properly was a nice bonus to this appointment. Dr. Yeung recommend some OTC treatments to avoid the buildup again. Nicely done.When I explained a unique personal situation for scheduling, Dr. Yeung walked me over personally to conference in her billingscheduling staff to make it work.  Her entire practice felt it was an important issue because it was important to me.PreOp Appointment:I saw an Nurse Practioner at San Francisco Otolaryngology for his preop.  The NP was very personable and gave great advice on recovery tips.Day of Surgery:Dr. Yeung arrived punctually to the prep area with a positive, upbeat attitude. I felt very calm climbing onto the OR table with Dr. Yeung in charge. The coblation bilateral tonsillectomy went smoothly and finished on time. I woke up in recovery with surprisingly less pain than expected. I remember Dr. Yeung saying I she used a local on my throat to buy me some extra time from pain in the initial few hours after surgery. Swallowing ice water and percocet tablets was way easier than I thought it would be. I had expected to wake up to the sensation of glass shards in my throat. Dr. Yeung stopped my about an hour postop and confirmed the tonsil crypts were very deep and warranted removal. It was nice to hear that validation  it helps to make the pain seem worthwhile. I asked her which procedure she had used  I was relaxed to hear coblation. I had read that coblation was a much less painful recovery over electrocautery procedures. I had been hesitant to ask beforehand  didn\'t want to psyche myself out and decided to trust my surgeon\'s judgement on how to do surgery. It was still good to hear she used a more progressive technique.PostOp Appointment:Once again, Dr. Yeung was very positive on candid at my postop appointment. She listened and answered my entire list of questions I had compiled over a week sitting in bed.  Pathology reported a minor complication with the tonsils, and Dr. Yeung was very encouraging about the prognosis and treatment. I laughed when she said the bad news was 3 weeks on antibiotics. I told her bad news would only be going back into surgery and undoing 7 days of nursing the scabs in the back of throat. Outcome:So far, I am 100% happy with my decision to have my tonsils removed and 100% satisfied with Dr. Yeung as my surgeon. My overall health should improve in the long run. Thank you, Dr. Yeung!'),(894,194,4,'Dr Yeung gave me the information I needed to better understand what\'s been plaguing me since I was a child. I didn\'t get the diagnosis I was hoping for tympanoplasty but she did put me on the right track for helping solve my discomfort.I did not have very good experiences with the staff, including the manager, however, thus one less star. If Dr. Yeung were at an office with a better support team perhaps one that doesn\'t interrupt a client appointment to ask about a lunch request!, she\'d have gotten 5 stars for being thorough and understanding.'),(895,194,5,'I have had chronic sinus problems for 15 years.

Dr. Hassler is an amazing doctor that provides service at that same high end level. He is empathetic, genuine, and completely professional. What I really enjoyed about my visit is that he takes a holistic approach when it comes to health care. I made an appointment for my annual physical, and he made sure to address everything from my work life balance to my diet and exercise regimen. Not only did he inquire about my my physical ailments, but he also took the time to address psychiatric issues as well. What I really like about him is that he is a hip doctor. I was able to be completely honest about my personal life and habits without feeling like I was being judged. He asked me relevant questions and listened to my concerns about everything from fluoride in toothpaste to needing to be sedated while flying all without making me feel like a nutcase. Best of all, he spent the full duration of our appointment getting to know me and my medical history. He asked me so many questions, you can tell that he genuinely enjoys his profession.

Dr. Maeck if you\'re reading this, give Alexander another raise. He deserves every bit of it.The best thing Dr. Maeck has done for me so far is followedup with a phone call. Simple. Folks that experience moderate to severe medical problems will see the doctor for diagnosis, get treated, feel better, pay out the ass when the bills come in, and never hear from the doctor again. A couple weeks after a health scare that was initially diagnosed by Dr. Maeck and later resolved by several visits to specialists at St. Mary\'s Hospital, Dr. Maeck called me to see how I was feeling. None of the other doctors I had seen during this scare called, but Dr. Maeck did. He wanted to make sure that I was not only feeling better, but that we were taking the steps necessary to prevent the illness from ever coming back.

He actually got me to understand what was wrong with me. When I went to the Bodies exhibit a few weeks after, I got all excited because I could show others which muscle was all screwed up!Not only did the doc listen, but he went into preventative things as well and scheduled me for something in for a general check up to make sure that some things that I was experiencing weren\'t coming from other things.

Over the years, I have witnessed Dr Maeck \'s style of my treatment very personal and comprehensive.

Then you call and they aren\'t accepting new patients or something.Well, I searched YELP and it led me to BMIII MD. He is even better than my old Dr. Don\'t bitch if you have to wait 15  30 minutes to get into see him. I find that super annoying considering: most people are late probably throwing off most dr\'s schedules in the first place and do you really want him to watch the seconds tick and tock and kick you out when your 20 minutes are up? This is typical of all dr appointments in my experience including dentists.Now...to the bizness. He is very knowledgeable, attentive, caring and actually has a genuine interest in his patients.

I gave him a chance over a period of time but the exams were indifferent didn\'t bother to get really basic stuff, he did chat a lot however. Over the course of being his patient what he did do was issue blood tests that he would insist I come to the office to have done vs providing a lab slip for taking to an outpatient lab like every other medical practitioner I\'ve been to most of whom will even simply fax the lab form and call back with results. My insurance bills explained a lot though, even though I\'d only go to have the blood drawn, a couple of minutes phlebotomy only with no \'visit\', my bills revealed that I was also being charged $$ for an office visit.

I dont wrote many reviews, but I have to sound off about this guy.My first visit to Dr. Maeck was for a physical in which he had a great bedside manner and seemed to be a genuine person. So when I was actually sick I went back to him. Worst mistake I have made thus far. I had a headache, elevated fever, and generally felt like someone hit me with a bus. I assumed flu.Since Dr. Maeck was so great the first time, I assumed he knew what he was talking about. When he took my temperature and he saw it was 103 he literally said Oh, my God! kind of panicked and told me he thought I might have a brain bleed because I had a high fever and a headache. Yes, a brain bleed. You can imagine what was going through my head and that I needed to go to the emergency room right away.We get down to the emergency room he did walk me down in which I am freaking out on top of being sick. They check me in and run a MRI, do the swine flu test and so on. After three hours in the hospital and IV of fluids and four advil later, I felt fine. WTH?!The emergency room doctor said it was Sinus infection and slight dehydration! Even after they tell Dr. Maeck this, he still attempts to order a blood test that the ER doctors told me was pretty much BS. I declined thank god. How does a brain bleed go to Sinus infection?! I have been to good doctors before that would have never been an alarmist or fail to check for basic problems before sending someone into the hospital, but this guy did.After this whole ordeal; I am stuck with $1900 bill after insurance in which more random bills keep showing up. Total bill logged in at $5,000My take is this, I will graciously give up beside manner if they know what he or she are talking about. Only go to him for routine check ups not illness.'),(955,197,5,'My company finally wised up and started offering Blue Cross PPO and after my first visit with Dr. Maeck today, I am really glad I switched over and got out of the Brown & Toland HMO game. Dr. Maeck doesn\'t take HMOs and due to this, he doesn\'t have to overload his schedule and he can spend a lot of time talking with you instead of just referring you out. He\'s got some great anatomy books and will actually explain your diagnosis to you. I really appreciate having a doctor actually educate me on my diagnosis as opposed to someone who just writes prescriptions. And, to top it off, there weren\'t 800 forms to fill out and he takes his own vital stats! Fanfuckingtastic.Edit: Dr. Maeck rules! He has a fantastic sense of humor, clearly cares about his patients and always returns phone calls. He is Primary care doc GOLD and if your insurance accepts him, I highly recommend seeing him.

He consistently monitors medications he prescribes, tests and adjusts at in my opinion reasonable rates. He even councils on drug interactions and recommends additives to make you more comfortable.

He shares a parttime receptionist with another doctor, but frankly I\'ve only gotten her once when I\'ve called. When you call him you are getting put directly to his paging system, so only call during business hours unless it\'s an emergency of course because as soon as you leave a message he will get paged and he will check the message as soon as he can, even if it\'s in the middle of the night hence be mindful of the hour that you call.

The front desk staff is also very nice.Dr. Khoo used to be at 2000 Van Ness but last July she moved out to the Inner Richmond.

I am so fed up with these small practice Drs who don\'t understand that I am not an idiot I\'ve had injuries before and I don\'t feel like waiting for an hour in the waiting room to then be referred somewhere else for nothing. If you break you arm you don\'t go to your primary so since I hurt my ribs I got Xrays which by the way she wouldn\'t refer me to so I got a referral from another Dr nearby. I am really upset that she told me I have to come in, hello I\'m in pain and I\'m asking for pain medication so I can freakin move and not be in pain. I know what bruised ribs are. To top it off I had an appointment on friday so I told her I could check in then anyways. She said if I need a phone Dr I should look elsewhere because she\'s not going to do stuff over the phone.

Nothing better than that when you feel terrible! She\'s very bright and answered all of my questions. She even wrote down a little cheat sheet for me so I know which over the counter prescription drugs are the best fit for my allergies and the occasional cold in addition to an Rx of course.

I have been going to her for over 2 years and even stuck around after they moved to the Richmond district. I do not like the PA though.

I told her what was wrong, but before I could tell her that I was moving away and wanted to make sure I was good on other things, she was already shooing me out after she diagnosed me. I know she\'s a straight forward, no nonsense, no lollygagging type of primary physician but the thought of her shooing me out before we could talk bothers me. I miss that conversational physician like my pediatrician who actually takes the time to know you on a more personal level and takes the time to carefully explain things.

I don\'t think anyone else would do that. So naturally when I stopped seeing a pediatrician, I switched over to her too.Dr. Khoo is very thorough. I agree that she is rushed as is all primary care physicians because they get reimbursed so little now from insurance companies, but she does make sure that you get everything that you need.I also think Dawn is a sweetheart  she has always been very friendly to me so perhaps that one reviewer caught her on a bad day...'),(1014,198,2,'While she is qualified and accessible, she really won\'t help you for the most basic need over the phone insisting you go in for a visit....which is not always possible to take a couple hours out of your day to make your way over there for a basic prescription.'),(1015,198,5,'I become flustered when it is time to choose a new doctor.

However, instead of making me wait without any word from anyone, Dr. Hassid himself mentioned through the doorway that he was running just a tad behind. i told him, no problem...I\'ve got my book...it\'s fine. And it was. I appreciated the fact that Dr. Hassid took the time to ask about my medical history personally instead of making me fill out ten pages of a questionnaire. He was warm and attentive, and took any medical concerns that I had seriously. He also suggested a few lab tests to check on things that I was concerned about. He even mentioned that I should call him five days after I complete the lab work so that he can explain the results to me which I thought was fantastic.

I visited him for an issue that has been effecting me for over 2 years and he spent an hour asking me questions, and selecting the appropriate blood tests. Sure enough, he discovered the issue, provided treatment and I feel like myself again. You can also reach him very easily and he calls you personally to respond to any questions.The front desk receptionistsecretary excuse me if that is not the proper title is lovely.

Then I began my search for another MD. Dr. Hassid is professional and knowledgeable. He definitely has many decades of clinical experience yet he never pretends that he knows all.

He is generally good at followup with test results though sometimes he may forgetif it\'s not urgent. He is very reasonable at ordering necessary lab teststhis I value very much. A note: the office does not take credit card but personal check or cash only. Really wish that they accept credit card. But the service charge at Dr. Hassid\'s is affordableyou get boutique high quality care! Labcorp is in the same building. I didn\'t have to wait in long line among crowds for my lab works.

Dr. listened to me, and questioned my symptoms, and in the end First time Ever prescribed me antibiotics and some other things.  Since I trust his judgement over the years, I got the meds, and lo and behold, the combination was perfect, his diagnosis spot on. Also, Dr. Hassid checks both our charts when either of us come to him, and always asks about the health of one another, and reminds us if the other one is due for something.

I don\'t know who has time to wait two months when they want to see a doctor but I do not.I wrote a review about this and Yelp took it down because I lacked firsthand customer experience, but if you ask me interacting with the office staff and making appointments falls under said firsthand experience  the office environment is almost as important as the doctor.Hopefully a few of you read this before Yelp takes down my comment yet again, and probably bans me from the site.Dr. Benjamin Maeck is wonderful and will most likely fit you into his schedule within a day or two.Oh and Yelp User Support, I\'m taking a screenshot of the review to show whoever will look at it after you take it down. I\'ve read the guidelines and I\'m within them. I have to admit though you have some cajones when it comes to ratings manipulation.'),(1055,200,4,'A victim of his own success?Dr. Selle has been my doctor for several years now  years during which I\'ve had some unusual and lifethreatening health problems  and my appreciation for him knows no bounds. Unfortunately, I guess many others feel the same. I just returned from a trip with several problems that require urgent attention. No sameday appointments. No sameweek appointments. A week out is the best the receptionist could offer. I took the appointment, but I\'m disappointed at best. As a current patient, I would have expected to be able to see my doctor on a somewhat urgent schedule for an urgent issue.OK  a few hours after the above review was posted I received a call back from a different person at Selle\'s office than I had spoken to that morning. She told me they could see me the following day, late afternoon.

He believes that western medicine should not be exclusive or eastern, homeopathic or any other options available. He will always try least invasive treatment first and I love that. I\'ve known Dr.Selle since he was an intern. Always hardworking, always trying new approach, he projected confidence and competency.Both my mom and my husband are now his patients and are thankful for his flexibility with appointments and great office staffenvironment.

Thanks to Yelpers giving honest rave reviews about Dr. Selle, I have finally found the doctor of my dreams. Writing reviews are a chore, but I feel the need to give back to the Yelp community for helping me on the path to healing. I like that Dr. Selle is a Doctor of Osteopath who generally looks at a problem holistically and provides long term solutions. Dr. Selle listened patiently and sympathetically as I explained my situation and I felt we actually had a productive dialogue about my health. I have had chronic back pain and anxiety for the past 4 years. Instead of referring me to a chiropractor or physical therapist like my previous General Practitioners, he referred me to a topnotch pain specialist Dr. Judy Silverman at SF St. Mary\'s Spine Center. Dr. Selle is techsavvy! The office utilizes an electronic health record EHR and an online patient portal to organize information and maximize efficient communications with their patients. I can send him email messages and get a personalized response from him within 12 days! Also, he provides brilliant informative handouts for further reading and research on my own. be a proactive patient :.Another wonderful thing I like about this doctor is his belief in FOLLOW UP\'s. Go figure! Other doctors I have seen really don\'t care how I do in a few months time and never requests a follow up. But Dr. Selle wants to see if his recommendations have helped you or not. If yes, great! If not, how can we make it better? I feel that Dr. Selle doesn\'t just send you out the door and give up on you. His staff is also kind and helpful. When I needed an earlier appointment, I appreciated that they called me back to let me know of a cancellation and I was able to take that spot.A+ Bedside manners A+ Correct diagnosis and referral to a great specialistA+ Use of technologyA+ Follow up!It is nice to have a caring doctor you can trust.'),(1059,200,1,'I would have loved to meet with DO Selle since the very positive reviews on yelp. I called to schedule an appointment and I was told that the earliest available appointment for new patients would be 3 months away. Then I asked if i had any other option since i didn\'t want to wait for that long. I was told that there were none. Then I asked for referral to other DO that the doctor trusts and I was told they do not know anyone. Really? do you really do not know any other doctor? Then I asked what was i supposed to do if I were in pain. The secretary told me call your insurance. I do not think this is the proper way to conduct business, especially in the medical profession. I am glad i am not visiting this DO and good luck to all new patients!'),(1060,200,5,'I\'ve been seeing Dr. Selle for more than a year and am VERY impressed with his skills and thoughtfulness!

I especially like how well he blends Westerntype medicine with alternative approaches and the thoroughness of his recommended tests, medications, etc. I definitely feel that he has my best interests at heart.'),(1061,200,5,'Dr. Selle is awesome!I recently switched to him as my Primary Care Physician and requested that he gives me a full physical exam and prescribes some lab test for me. He gave me a very thorough exam, answered all of my questions very thoroughly and patiently, and even suggested some alternative treatments to try for things that I would not have thought to ask him about. E.g. he asked me if I had tried taking probiotic supplements  I had not  and pointed out that in some patients they have had beneficial effects for a condition I have. Since they benefit the body in all sorts of ways and have few, if any, downsides  sideeffects, he suggested I consider taking probiotics to see if they improve my general wellbeing.Dr. Selle also very graciously agreed to prescribe the lab tests I requested. When it turned out that there was an issue with the lab tests order because of my insurance\'s and the lab\'s complex and unreasonable rules, he readily agreed to take the time to issue me a new lab tests order, even though it was through no fault of his that the first one would not go through.All in all, you can tell from the first appointment that Dr. Selle not only has a great breadth of knowledge and a very alert and open mind as any physician should, but also really cares about his patients wellbeing and wants to do whatever is necessary to improve it as only the best physicians do.'),(1062,200,5,'Still the best doc I\'ve ever had, I trust him implicitly and my whole family see\'s him!'),(1063,200,5,'Dr. Selle is truly one of a kind in the western medicine world.

In one visit he covered more of my health concerns than my previous doctor had in 4 visits. I did not feel rushed, he spent at least 30 minutes with me, I think it was closer to 45. He gave me a lot of good advice and I feel like I can completely trust him.He personally called me about my lab test results and when I emailed him with other questions, he responded the next day. He said he would call in a prescription for me and he did.I am surprised a doctor this good is still taking new patients, so if you are someone looking for a new primary MD, I would try and get in to see him before his practice closes to new patients.If you like the technological stuff, he does have online medical records, secure email access, and online appointment scheduling, and he does not charge extra for this. His web site also has a lot of useful information.The last thing he said was that he was looking forward to working with me to keep me at my optimum level of health.

He strikes me as a genuinely curious and caring person who is in this for the right reasonpeople\'s health.He is not in a rush, which is totally different than other docs I have seen. Specifically I am inspired to write this because outside of the fact that all of my experiences with him have been really good, tonight I had a minor health question and he called me and spoke to me for 30 minutes, what doctor does that?He is down to earth, lowkey and by far the best doctor I\'ve ever dealt with.'),(1066,200,5,'I had a horrific experience with my old doctor.

Comparing to my previous experience they were angels! Speaking in general terms of customer service 4,75 stars. They put me on hold once and it looked like they forgot, funny enough I called cause was running ten min late. Called while walking towards the office building. 10 min on hold I walk in with the phone in my hand still waiting and I see that one receptionist is busy with people the other one is indeed on the phone with someone.

Dr. John Selle is simply the BEST DOCTOR I EVER HAD. PERIOD. I have been with Dr Selle for THREE years now. He has been my guiding primary care physician through A LOT of injuries and issues. He has the BEST BED SIDE MANNER I have Experienced from a Doctor. He really get\'s to Know his patients and he does everything he can to HELP YOU GET BETTER. I even like his office staff and I usually DESPISE office assistants. Shaley is very Knowledgeable and very well organized. One of the Best things about Dr. Selle is he doesn\'t have that fake attitude like he knows everything. I sometimes find that pee brained doctors with tiny little penises like to pretend like they know everything and you\'re just supposed to sit there and take their word as law. Those kind of guys usually get a word of advise from me and if necessary Much More corrective things done to them.. Anyways back to Doc Selle, He is SIMPLY the BEST. He has managed my health through a Broken back, a broken leg, nerve damage, wrist damage, a shoulder and etc.. He was dealt with my job, the VA, and many other complicated situations. Best of All he actually THINKS, which is unfortunately uncommon now a days. I can\'t say enough positive things about this GREAT DOCTOR. I wanna thank you Yelpers before me that recommended this GREAT DOC. He is Not afraid to take GREAT CARE of Us the patient and he Knows how to do it.

I had to get bloodwork done before I went, so the receptionist scheduled me an appointment at a lab so far south of me that it stretches to breaking the usual conception of the bounds of San Francisco. When I got back I checked on google mapsyeah, the same company has labs scattered all through the city, including one less than a mile from my house.The physical itself was as pleasant as one might hope for. Can I have sex with my girlfriend Meave G. without putting latex on my penis? Go for it!A month later, the problems started. With the billing, I mean. My insurance gives me one physical every two years, free of deductible. Yet I received a bill from Dr. Selle\'s office. I called my insurance to ask about itit turned out the office had used the wrong diagnostic code on the claim, so it didn\'t look like a physical. Fine. I call the doctor\'s office and let them know they need to refile the claim with the correct code. They agree to do so.A month later, I receive a new bill. I call the insurance company. Same situation. They didn\'t even refile the claim. I call the office and yell.A month later, I receive a new bill. I call the office first. Me: I\'m tired of being the gobetween here. My insurance and I agree that I get a free physical. Your office and I agree that I went to you for a physical. It\'s up to you to reconcile the difference. Receptionist: Ok, I\'ll try that and call you back.She does not call back.Repeat approximately monthly to last Monday now we\'re in July. I get the same bill, this time stamped PAST DUE. I am prepared to consider any change progress. I call the office, only to find that they have as of the start of the month retained a third party to manage their billing. Thank jesus, I think. I call the company, they understand the problem, they resubmit the claim.Let\'s hope I don\'t have to update this review in a month.*** UPDATE 8222007 ***Hey guess what! That third party? Not so great! But at least they\'re proactive. I got a call this morning from a very nice woman threatening to break my kneecaps. After a little negotiation, she and I got into a conference call with my insurance, who politely informed her that yes, the billing code was STILL wrong. I can only assume that her face was red. She is resubmitting, we\'ll see what happens.The worst part of this last episode: in the months that this whole debacle has taken, my insurance changed from giving me a 100% free physical every two years to a 90% free physical every year.

He certainly doesn\'t jump to medicate, but neither does he hesitant when appropriately needed.Really respect this guy,Charlie'),(1078,200,5,'I have never had good luck with doctors.The first I can remember was my pediatrician, who had long, bony, extremely cold hands, and who gave me shots. Lots of shots. Obviously this was unforgivable and has forever clouded my judgment of the poor man. I mean, I\'m sure he was very nice, but all I really recall are those cold hands prodding my warm little body. And the shots, good lord.My second was sort of an inbetween doctor I visited when I was too old for the pediatrician and my family was too poor to see anyone who wasn\'t, say, my friend\'s dad who cut us a break. He totally ratted me out when I was faking sick, though, all prescribing me overthecounter Dimetapp and telling me I was definitely well enough to go straight from his office to school. Thanks, Evelyn\'s dad. That\'s the last time I clear my place at your dinner table.When we moved north after my sophomore year of high school because my dad got a job that made us both insured and not poor, we had to pick a new doctor. My mother and I, feeling whimsical, picked the guy with the weirdest name in the list of HMOapproved primary care providers. This was a terrible mistake. Did you know that certain medical plans won\'t let you change your doctor if it turns out he\'s so into homeopathy he doesn\'t want to prescribe you antibiotics for the outofcontrol infection that\'s caused your leg to swell so much you can\'t even walk?In some wretchedly ironic twist I found myself the au pair for a family whose patriarch was actually the managing director of the Deutsche Homoeopathische Union, owners of Nature\'s Way, meaning that I was up to my eyeballs in herbal remedies and weird salts. Now, I like to take care of myself as much as the next girl  I\'m a vegetarian, I drink at least three liters of water a day, plenty of exercise, you know  but there is a reason why people take drugs: They are EFFECTIVE. That\'s not to say that eating cow that\'s been pumped full of antibiotics so that it doesn\'t get sick living crammed together with thousands of other cows, eating groundup bits of other animals that have also been subsisting on a meatandantibiotics diet is good so much as really, really bad for you, but when you have an infection, take something that comes from the damn pharmacy, you know?When I came back from the land of arnica guernica?, I was determined to find a doctor who would actually listen to me and not make me feel weird about wanting drugs. Happily, two job, seven months and a couple new HMOs later, I found him in Dr. Selle. He\'s the closest doctor on my plan, so my HMO sort of assigned him to me  although you can be sure I checked on that option to switch before I formally agreed to anything. I was dubious, but one visit put all my doubts to rest. After so many healthcare debacles, it\'s like winning some kind of contest every time I go in.Oh, the love I have for Dr. Selle. He is the perfect combination of holistic and practical. I have weird, uncomfortable physical reactions to stress, the most recent coming in the form of a particularly itchy postsunburnstyle rash. What did Dr. Selle do? Told me to treat the actual symptom with aloe vera gel, and then asked me about everything that could be causing me stress. Because he is so nice and earnest, I found it very easy to tell him all about my inability to sleep, how long it had been going on, and all the other stress factors in my life that I am not going to share with the rest of you right now.I left the office with a pamphlet on sleep hygiene and a prescription for generic Ambien. Almost makes me wish I were in poorer health so I\'d have an excuse to go in more often. Okay fine, that\'s a complete lie, but I DO love my doctor.

He was affable and seemed to know what he was doing  to his credit he diagnosed a torn ligament in my thumb without an MRI, and I was only there for an annual checkup. However, his follow through was sloppy. He sent me for labs, but didn\'t get all the labs I asked for. When he called to follow up, he said everything looked good. I had to ask him about each test individually, at which point he realized he forgot to add the one test I was most interested in. Now I have to go draw blood again. He sent me to a thumb surgeon that was out of my network. The second thumb surgeon I saw wouldn\'t offer me an initial consult for a month. My ligament had a confirmed tear at this point. I asked Dr. Clothier if I should be treating this urgently, and he said I didn\'t need to. I called PAMF and they had an appointment for me the next week. That thumb surgeon told me that waiting longer could cause the ligament to recoil  that would require a much more complicated surgery to repair. He scheduled my surgery for the following day. Finally, the straw that broke the camel\'s back. I caught a cold and last night I got an asthma attack. My breathing was labored, but I stuck it out until the morning and then called first thing. I told the receptionist that I was having trouble breathing and that I needed an inhaler. She took my info and said she would get back to me asap with either a prescription for an inhaler or instructions to come ingo to urgent care. The key point here is I was HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING. An hour later I called again, she said she would check again. No call back. An hour later I called again. They were at lunch. An hour later I called again. Still at lunch. And hour later I called again. I asked why I had to call 5 times and wait 5 hours for Dr. Clothier to take the two minutes to HELP ME BREATHE. Not being able to breathe is scary. The receptionist finally understood the urgency, put me on hold, and a minute later she told me the prescription had been called in.

I called Clothier\'s office this morning and they assured me this would be taken care of before end of day today... It\'s 4:48 pm and no call from Clothier\'s office. ASTHMA folks, like... I need to breathe.  I\'m changing GPs. This is NOT the first time this has happened. Bottom line... don\'t even.'),(1092,201,5,'I am the sort of person who avoids physicians at all costs. I was raised by a pediatrician, and both of my siblings are also physicians. I grew up watching what the medical institution does to people, what insurance headaches do to people, and what long nights without sleep, late night calls at the beck of disturbed patients, and impossible situations without solutions do to people. Needless to say I did not become a physician; as I said, I actually avoid them.Having said all that, I recognize that sometimes you need a little help. As a daily commuter cyclist, i have injured my knee several times, and been hit by cars twice. I have injured my knees running, torqued my lower back while working hunched for hours, and strained my wrists with poor work ergonomics. Doctor Clothier is always the person I go to when I have medical issues beyond my own scope of knowledge and care. He has always been consistent about not only how to address my injuries, but how to prevent them with exercise, care, and occasional medicines. He is a true physician in that he values health over the institution of healthcare. He has consistently treated me over the years and yet I never feel the crushing presence of an outofcontrol medical institution, but rather the friendly comfort of someone who understands health, and balance. I find several of these reviews on here strange in that they complain about the medical institution as a whole, and yet Dr. Clothier has been my sole guide through this maze for much of my adult life, and has consistently led me through it with a loving, approachable humanity I find exceedingly rare. It saddens me to see people unawares how fortunate they are that Dr. Clothier is this line of work, for he is exceptional and far beyond what you will normally find in physicians.My most recent interaction with him involved getting a painful procedure done, and his recommendations and thoughts about it. It struck me in hindsight that I actually didn\'t thank him after his consult for being a bright and shining light in a worrisome situation. I realized I had come to him so wrapped up into my own thoughts and concerns that I had neglected to notice his breadth of help. In some ways physicians have the most thankless of jobs, filled with days of whiny, uncooperative people looking to scapegoat someone for their own illmanaged health issues. And yet I left him smiling, with my issues resolved.Thanks John, I truly appreciate it.'),(1093,201,1,'UPDATE: Downgrading to 1 star. Just received a bill today from Dignity Health for $117 for a service I do not recall having. I\'ve paid all my copays up to this point and was not informed of any services requiring extra billing certainly not to the tune of $1157 before insurance. The bill includes no mention of the service provided, so I\'m at a complete loss of what to make of this. Like any reasonable consumer, I\'m not in the habit of simply paying bills that have no justification. FIX THIS PLEASE FOLKS!I have mixed feelings about Dr. Clothier\'s establishment.On the Staff...This has been my biggest pain point. They are oftentimes unresponsive to requests for appointments and their medical records systems seem to be going through a frustrating transition period. There are times where I\'ve called and left messages 2 and 3 times over a two week period and have never gotten a call back. This to me is unacceptable and unprofessional. I think I also fall into Carrie L\'s issue on blood samples. I recently got a random call from St. Francis saying I owed around $120 for an unspecified operationservice. Having only been to Dr. Clothier\'s office in the past year. I found this odd. Still have not found a resolution to this problem yet as I\'ve only ever gotten a call regarding a bill that I\'ve never received apparently they mailed it to me. On Dr. Clothier...He\'s an extremely nice guy and an athlete himself. As an athlete I can appreciate his understanding of active lifestyles. He\'s straight to the point and thorough to a degree. HOWEVER, if you\'re looking for a guy who will sit down with you and try to troubleshoot your health concerns or questions, he\'s probably not for you. Overall... Honestly a tad frustrated at the moment. I hope the patient management here can improve more as it\'s currently their biggest drawback.'),(1094,201,3,'So after my one star review, Dr. Clothier contacted me and explain the situation to me. Apparently, he sent my blood samples to St. FrancisDignity Health and from there on the billing was not in his control. He did apologize and said that it has happened before and he\'s talked to people on that end. He also took time to help me deal with this situation asked for my bill and I guess is now talking to Dignity Health for me. I could tell he genuinely is a nice guy, which is why I upped his rating. I also do believe he is a capable doctor, but perhaps just not what I was looking for.I really struggled between increasing it up to 2 or 3 stars, and if there were 12 stars, I\'d give it 2.5 stars. But because of the doctors willingness to help, I leaned towards 3 stars.My one bit of critical advice though  double check on whether your blood tests are covered and see where they are being sent to. This has seriously been a source of headache for the last year.'),(1095,201,2,'Let me say first that Dr. Clothier is, in my opinion, and excellent physician.Now on to what constitutes a twostar review:BILLING: Bill received from Dignity Health had no breakdown, no address, nothing. I sent a letter asking for more explanation. No response. Unacceptable.SCHEDULING: I called and asked for a standard preemployment screening. After arriving I was told by the receptionist that Dr. Clothier does not do screenings and that I should have mentioned this over the phone. This demonstrates a severe lack of personal accountability. I am a contractor: cost  $350  day rate, + $15 parking + 3 hours of my time.PHONE ETIQUETTE: I called twice and left a voicemail asking for an appointment with no returned call. If the staff is not returning calls then shut off the voicemail. Easy.2030 years ago none of this would have happened.

I have been going to Dr. Clothier for over 5 years. He is an excellent doctor and even though he\'s a busy guy, he has always been flexible to fit me in quickly when issues come up. He has a great attitude and a casual professionalism that makes him easy to talk with. I was compelled to write this review as I recently injured my right knee and it was locked up without a full range of motion. Dr. Clothier is an athlete and appreciated my concern and the urgency. He saw me about 2 hours after I called the reception desk. He was extremely through, had the xrays completed on the spot, and he filed a request with my PPO for an MRI to be completed. His office staff followed through with Aetna when they initially rejected the MRIs and Dr. Clothier personally gave his rationale for the further reviews and the MRI. It was approved. Dr. Clothier followed up with recommendations of Orthopedists for me to consider. Dr. Clothier was a great find for me.

He kept emailing me and leaving me a voice mail he hasn\'t received my lab results. I called Quest the other day and they said they emailed him the results via electronically. Also they said they faxed it to him. So what is wrong with the delay. This is the reason I gave them two stars and I\'m still not feeling good and don\'t know what is wrong with me.

I am impressed by his going the extra mile attitude. You don\'t get that from a lot of MDs nowadays. Bottom line, I am happy with his performance and I will be keeping him as my PCP.

I didn\'t know that was Dr. Clothier, until I checked with my insurance, and by all means it should have been an in and out procedural thing. I had no more symptoms, didn\'t need any medication, I just went to see him because an ER doctor told me to. Dr. Clothier seemed to agree that there isn\'t much for him to do, and though he did seem busy he and I talked for a while and then he checked my pulse and heard something strange and then asked me permission to do an EKG because he was concerned about my heart rate. He then had me go to a cardiologist who confirmed a pretty serious issue that must have been going on for years without me realizing it. I\'m currently getting treated for that, but I have no doubt that if it wasn\'t for Dr. Clothier this issue would have gone unchecked until something serious or potentially life threatening occurred.

He even got off the elevator at my floor one time to continue listening to what I was telling him slight complication wmy pregnancy, and told me to come by his office that very day so he could hear all the details and examine me himself. Today he squeezed me in on short notice because I\'ve been having awful headaches for two weeks, and he wanted to do all he could to help me solve the mystery diagnosis that the ER couldn\'t seem to figure out.

He\'s interested in what\'s going on in your life, and how it impacts your health. He\'s designed his entire practice to be able to spend that time with his patients. He\'s also extremely knowledgable and will ensure you get the treatment you need.For a brief period sometime during 20112012, his practice ended up taking on more patients than it could handle thanks to the awesome Yelp reviews. As a result, he expanded his practice to include Dr. Kim, who is also a great doctor. So yes, during that transition, I noticed longer wait times and it being harder to get in to see Dr. Savant. During this time Mark added a concierge service so people who wanted him 247 could have it. Obviously nothing comes for free, so there is an annual charge. I would love to do it, but I decided I couldn\'t afford it. RECENT Experiences: I have been 4 times in the last six months, and I will tell you that each time I have arrived early. Each and every time I have been taken to an exam room within 10 minutes of arrival.

When it comes to Dr. Kim Ive never seen Dr Savant but Im sure he is amazing too I am always welcomed with open arms and a warm greeting. He does not rush mehe listens and let\'s me get all my feelings out. He sits there with his little computer and takes notes and also really genuinely pays attention to YOUR needs. He is SO accommodating. I\'ll never use another dr. If I could give them 10 stars I would.'),(1163,203,5,'I feel the need to chime in here. Dr. Savant is hands down the best doctor I have ever seen in my life. Now, for me that says a lot because I recently went through a major life changing illness. I won\'t elaborate on the details of my condition but suffice it to say that I ended up receiving a stem cell transplant which required intensive after care. With luck, I found Dr. Savant and after 3 years of illness and treatment, he became my primary care physician.What a relief. To find a doctor that is not only brilliant medically, but also compassionate and one who never, I mean never, rushes the visit. We all know that some visits to your doctor are quickies and others require a bit more time, depending upon what is going on.Prior to becoming so ill, I had always been healthy, never sick. Suddenly, my life changed dramatically as I had lost the membership of someone considered healthy.  Dr. Savant was attentive, in touch and astute to the entire experience. I could not have asked for a better physician for my aftercare. Eventually, I regained my health but continue to deal with the after effects of those years of illness as well as the aggressive treatment I had. Again, Dr. Savant skillfully and kindly led me through the painful long months of healing and escorted me back to heath and subsequently work, as a full duty police officer.Then, at the beginning of 2012, we received a Savant Wellness Package in the mail it require us to pay a lump some, yearly, to belong to his practice and continue to see Dr. Savant. It ranged but I think my cost, and my partner\'s, was in the ballpark of $2000.00 annually for each of us. At first we were shocked, even a bit indignant. My initial reaction was: Okay, he\'s great but that is way too much money. Let\'s look around for another doctor, one that doesn\'t ask for a fee to see him. We found ourselves back in the ratrace of hurried doctors that didn\'t even bother to ascertain our medical history from the simplest things like whether we smoked to my major recent illness. Sigh... We missed good medicine, we missed Dr. Savant.My partner and I talked about the annual fee and searched online about physicians charging fees. We realized that the best doctors are moving towards this practice and evaluated for ourselves what we wanted, for our own healthcare. After careful consideration, we decided that excellent medicineDr. Savant was worth it. After all, I had long since experienced the contrary and after having been extremely ill, our decision became a no brainer. We paid. And you know what? I\'m glad we did. In short, there is no price on health, good health. Unfortunately, we often don\'t realize it until it is something we have lost...Dr. Savant is an amazing physician. If you can afford to pay his fees, I highly encourage you to do so. Nothing is more important than your health even if that is hard to fathom when you have it.'),(1164,203,5,'The Short: Compassionate, timely, efficient.The Long:I made my appointment about 4 weeks ago, showed up on time, waited about 3 minutes to be seen, and had Dr. Savant\'s uninterrupted attention for about an hour. He brought his laptop into our session, and was taking copious notes about everything. I had brought a few pieces of paper from my last appointment, and he efficiently scanned them in to my file. There was almost no paperwork, except for the notes and prescriptions he printed out.Personally, Dr. Savant is awesome. He was a classics major, and then became a doctor. He is funny, compassionate, and probably the best doctor I\'ve ever seen. I hope his practice thrives enough that he knows he is loved, but not so much that making an appointment is impossible.'),(1165,203,1,'Unfortunately, this office has questionable ethics standards. I strongly recommend reviewing the bill and discussing the charges with the doctor  the front desk won\'t cooperate much post factum.I was looking for an OBGYN, and, by mistake, I ended up in this office. I waited for 35 minutes in the waiting room just to find out that I came to the wrong doctor. The doctor did manage to ask me if I smoked, drank, and did drugs. He also asked if my parents had any health issues. And that\'s when we got to the mistaken OBGYN part. We shook hands and wished each other a good day. Imagine my surprise when I got a bill for a complete !! physical exam. When I called to clarify the situation, the front desk said that it was their policy to charge people I think as soon as they schedule or enter the office. She would not correct the charge!I suggest they should have a credit card machine at the door by the door knob because, apparently, sitting in their waiting room is not free!Also, I am a CPA, and my billing rate is $280. I sat in their office for 35 minutes. I think they owe me $163! They got as much of my accounting services as much I got of the physical exam, but I had to pay.

He was my doctor since 2005 when I moved here from Chicago.  Sadly we now do need to part ways because of this whole annual fee deal. I just can\'t afford him after I pay for my insurance. And sadly, while I did think to go to Dr. Kim, I\'ve noticed a decline in the great customer service I used to receive before this whole annual fee. Now when trying to get perscriptions, leaving messages, or at times when I actually talked to the receptionist  it\'s like pulling teet to get a response. Because of the lack of response from the front desk I\'ve decided to just find another doctor.It comes down to this  if you can afford to pay the additional fee, Dr. Savant is a great doctor and I can\'t say enough. If like me, you can\'t  just move on to another doctor\'s office. Even though I assume Dr. Kim is good  you have to deal with the front desk which has sadly declined in it\'s service.'),(1168,203,5,'I couldn\'t agree more with the 5 stars rating for Dr. Savant....being a typical male I avoid the doctor at all costbecause you know nothing is ever wrong with us guys.

And it does not matter  I don\'t even want to know if your annual fee is really $1500 a year on top of copay as some reviewers state here on Yelp.

I start coughing all over his face. Not cute. Something had to be done.In the four years that I have lived in the Bay Area, I never really had any reason to go to the doctor so I didn\'t really have one.Turned to Yelp and originally wanted to make an appointment with Dr Savant. Nothing available for a few weeks. Oh noes! I had to stop coughing. So I was thinking that, you know, good doctors, work with good doctors. So I asked if there was anyone else that could take me. They offered Dr Kim for a same day appointment. I was in.Went in, saw Dr Kim and was amazed. I was so used to doctors, sticking a swab down my throat, asking me like 2 questions, and be out of there in 5 minutes with a prescription. Dr Kim actually talked to me for a good 30 minutes about my symptoms what kind of activities I do, all kinds of stuff to help fix this incredibly annoying issue I was having.So yeah, a week later, cough all gone.

I have had growing frustration with Dr. Kim that came to a head this week when I had a serious medical problem. I felt ok to drive initially, but by the time that I arrived at Dr Kim\'s office, I was extremely dizzy and week. He said that I looked really sick, wrote me a prescription and sent me on my way to have lab work done before I went home. I ended up collapsing in the lobby of the lab downstairs and spent the entire day in the ER. The nurses and medical staff were shocked that he not only sent me off, but that he immediately left for the day and wasn\'t returning calls. I heard nurses saying that he had no business sending me out in my condition. Later the nurses  medical staff in the lab and ER told me that they called Dr Kim and had left messages regarding my situation and status. I have not heard from him or anyone in his office since. Is this how you expect a family Dr. to treat you? No calls to see how you\'re doing? My dog gets better treatment from our vet who calls to check on him when he has a rash.My wife found another Dr. a couple weeks prior to this because she was also frustrated with him. After this weeks experience I\'ll be doing the same.Based on my personal experience, I think he is just too young and inexperienced to deal with serious situations. And if that wasn\'t enough, he will treat like you are a child and not take what you have to say seriously. And even if you collapse in his building and have to be rushed to the ER, you will never get a call from his office checking to see how you\'re doing.  As a father and professional I find that attitude absolutely intolerable. He doesn\'t deserve my business or yours.'),(1181,203,5,'This office has been terrific for me. I am a patient of Dr. Kim.

Being a reasonably websavvy person, I tend to do my homework about what might be going wrong, and what to do about it. Dr. Kim talks to me at the level that I\'m at, and we come to an agreement on diagnostic approaches and the right specialist consultation or treatment we want to go with.

There\'s nothing worse than having to reintroduce yourself and recite your whole medical history every time you see the doctor. The front office Doris and Sofia are amazing as well. The only drawback is that you need to be prepared to wait like I said he\'s patient and compassionate, he takes notes, and he takes the time to answer any questions you have and explain whatever you don\'t understand meaning he may run alittle behind, but he\'s well worth the wait.

But tout au contraire, Dr. Savant lived up to the raves. His Q Q Q Q A A A format, versus Q A Q A Q A questionanswer etc., initially threw me off and made me wonder whether he was listening or caring, but he had truly excellent bedside manner and asked that rare Is there anything else? question at the end.

After having gone through 5 different doctors who absolutely refused to see new patients I found Dr. Mark Savant, MD as one of the highest rated doctors on Yelp. Although I never met with Dr. Savant but met with his partner Dr. Kim I am fully impressed with their establishment.Not only were they willing to take me as a new patient but I was able to get an appointment that day! He was really attentive and very youthful. He made the experience of going to a doctor which as you know most men don\'t enjoy fully enjoyable and comfortable.

I don\'t think I am going to be able to afford to stay with him because of his new concierge service, but I will miss his thorough explanations, his warmth great bedside manner! and his wisdom.

No more scribbly notes and yellow copy this and pink copy that... everything I need is printed out nice and neat for me.The wait wasn\'t bad and the office staff were actually really friendly  I know, can you imagine? There was no rushed feeling and no playing the game of which door is the doctor behind now. I didn\'t have brain freeze when I had the chance to ask any questions because I felt like I knew that I could always ask later! At last a doctor that I can actually have a conversation with and maybe even shoot the breeze a bit with.

Done deal.'),(1194,203,4,'I saw Mark last week, and the reviews didn\'t disappoint. He\'s a cool guy. I hadn\'t seen a doctor in a while, so I gave him a rundown of some of my concerns. He addressed all of them, explained things to me thoroughly, and gave me a few samples on top of my perscriptions.We exchanged a few bits about growing up in San Francisco. The conversation was really relaxed. I got the feeling that Mark cares more about a person as a whole than just their ailments. I really appreciated that.On the flip side, the Yelp recommendation comes at a price. In order to get an appointment with him, I had to book almost a month in advance. I picked the last available appointment on the day I went, and had to wait an extra 40 minutes to see him.Despite this, he took his time and wasn\'t in a rush. After we left the examination room, the entire office was emptyhe was the last guy to leave the office. That really says something to me about his commitment.As long as I don\'t have any immediate medical concerns, I\'d like to keep Mark as my doctor.'),(1195,204,5,'Dr. Moser is a wonderful man. He was at our hospital room within 15 minutes of our arrival. He is warm hearted and listens to all we had to say. He is compassionate and gentle.

On top of that, his office staff are just the most amazing group of professionals I\'ve ever dealt with in a medical office setting. They are friendly and very helpful both on the phone and in person. If you are fortunate enough to have Dr. Moser as your PCP, you will never want to see anyone else. Appointment times have always started on time or very close to on time, even though they post a message in the waiting room letting you know that they will take their time with every individual patient which could mean that appointments run behind schedule. And it\'s true.

Dr. Moser took his time with me and asked me on numerous occasions throughout my exam if I had any questions.He was everything I was hoping for and trust him without reservation with my medical care. Especially those looking to start HRT or looking for a new doctor to continue your HRT treatment, look to Dr. Moser.

He\'s like doctors were before medicine was ruined by managed care. He spends whatever time is needed BY YOU  never making you feel like his need to move to the next patient is priority one. You\'re always his first priority, and he\'s totally focused on you for as long as you need. And if you need to get in to see him because YOU feel it\'s urgent, then his staff will find a way. He cares about not just your body, but your mental well being as well.  He takes the time to dig a little deeper, and cover all the bases. His therapy background is not wasted in his general practice. He\'s highly intelligent, but not too arrogant to open up a reference guide when appropriate  a real gem.

I don\'t want to give up too much personal information here, but he caught something that was hurting me after I had seen many doctors and no one else was able to tell me what was wrong.

I have never felt more attended too  the best thing though is that he does not judge... you can tell him anything and like any Good Dr. should do, he gives his medical advice and moves on.Bonus: for any of you Trek fans out there, this is the place for you.

You are involved in your treatment.A few other notes: Dr. Moser never rushed through an appointment; Dr. Moser was willing to change his mind based on the results of a battery of blood tests we were initially going to pursue a more aggressive treatment regimen than we ultimately went with; Dr. Moser changed my mind about the efficacy of a particular drug by emailing me recent literature on the drug; I wouldn\'t describe Dr. Moser as either liberal or conservative with pharmaceuticals; his approach is pragmatic; Dr. Moser has a good sense of humor; Dr. Moser\'s staff is pleasure to deal with;I highly recommend Dr. Moser.'),(1220,204,5,'Awesome.

Twenty minutes into my appointment she finally showed up in the exam room. After listening to my heart for 5 seconds and spending about 5 minutes total with me, my 30 minute physical was over. I then proceeded to have labs drawn on that day which was Tuesday. After not hearing from the office by Friday, I went to the lab and obtained a copy of my results. This lab does not release results to the patient until the physician has had the results for 48 hours so I know she saw them. I had several abnormal lab results and at the time of this review, I still haven\'t been contacted by her or her office.

I have numerous medical issues and she has been able to navigate all of them with insight and care. I couldn\'t have the level of health I enjoy without her.'),(1258,207,1,'Dr. Capaldini comes across as a compassionate doctor who really cares about her patients. I begin seeing her earlier this year after leaving my doctor of six years, and our first consultation went well. She spoke about her love of animals, and her desire to be connected to her patients. All good, right? Yep, until today.Today, I was informed that Dr. Capaldini will be switching to a concierge services model, and will now be charging $1800 $2000 if you can\'t afford to hand it all over at once for the privilege of being her patient. That is ON TOP of what she will be charging your insurance company. Her argument, on paper, is that this model pays more attention to preventative medicine, therefore it\'s better. When I called her office to speak with someone about it, however, I was told the reason for the switch is that she has almost 2000 patients, and that it\'s not sustainable for her to continue doing so. When I asked if she could perhaps just see fewer patients, I was met with silence. The bottom line is, this doctor is ensuring that going forward, she only treats people with money. Considering the horrific state of healthcare in this country, I find it deplorable that she finds this an acceptable model. I\'m disgusted that she is trying to put forth the notion that she is somehow doing something noble. She is not. She is acting on greed, and she should, as a friend pointed out to me, be publicly shamed as such.'),(1259,207,5,'Headline: Truly extraordinary care with changes coming that can only improve healthcare outcomes for everyone. Sub Headline: No, she did not pay me to write this...I have been seeing Lisa as a patient for over seven years, but I\'ve been a fan of hers for over 15 years given her early and groundbreaking in vivo contributions to HIV treatment research and neurology. The number of times she has gone above and beyond expectations is uncountable, including somehow fitting in a sameday consultation with a relative that was in a crisis.For many years, it has been clear to me that her model of health care is not sustainable given the way that insurance companies and medicare now work, as she provides the deepest level of personal care with the almost unheard of ability to keep eliciting what is going on until all that should be said is on the table.I wanted to add this review now because although the new model of care Lisa is introducing hasn\'t yet been implemented, I have spent the time to research her plans and I am very impressed with how Lisa will transition her practice with minimal impact to those who do not wish to move to the concierge service the additional charges would bring. Many other top notch providers use a Physicians Assistant model where the routine sessions are handled by the P.A. and the Primary Care Physician is brought in to consult when anything out of the ordinary occurs. This will be the model patients not opting for the concierge service will receive, except that patients in her HIV practice will continue to receive primary attention from her.Change is often challenging, and it is human and easy to anticipate that any change will make things worse, but I would encourage everyone to chill and stay in communication with Lisa and her office in order to ensure ultimately she can make her practice workable for those who rely on her.'),(1260,207,1,'I\'m very disappointed by Dr. Capaldini\'s choice of the new model too. I like her a lot and I respect her right to restrict her patients to a few patients a year. Here\'s how the math works out from my point of view:I already pay for a high deductible insurance to the tune of $400+ a month. I see her maximum 34 times a year if that. So, if the $1800 is in addition, now I\'m paying $450$600 in addition to her normal fee of $150. That;\'s $600$750 per visit in addition the monthly insurance premium . All that money comes out of my pocket as it goes toward the deductible. Frankly, I would not pay that kind of money for any primary care physician.I totally respect Lisa\'s right to practice medicine in the way that suits her life needs the best. Sadly I will have to look elsewhere for a primary care physician. I will miss seeing Fabrizio too!Its truly sad that a once noble profession of healing people has gone down the path of dollars and cents in no way targeted at Lisa but my general feeling about medical care in the USA.'),(1261,207,1,'I recently moved to San Francisco and can\'t tell you how ecstatic I was to find a doctor here that I could trust.

Long story short...After struggling through Lisa\'s new office staff just to deal with insurance issues my first visit with the good Dr. after my partner died was an unexpected and avoidable disaster if Lisa knew how to do the right thing.... I was treated like a naughty child who disrupted her practice and told that six months out after my partner\'s death I should be in a better state of mind than I was....She asked me what I would tell one of my patients if they were in the same same place I was in then I am a psychologist, so through my tears and a broken heart I told her....Good thing she is not a mental health professional although she should have some of those skills!!!!If you don\'t need emotional support, empathy or understanding then she might meet your needs. If you need medication she might meet your needs but if you need an empathic person with a sense of her patients well being especially in a time of crisis and not oppose your needs to the needs of her office staff then look further. Oh, if you want a doc who will treat your dog well , better than she treats you, then she\'s your person....The disgust and humiliation I felt leaving her office that toxic day still lingers...But should I ever be in a situation with a dr who can\'t deal with real emotions and backs office staff so cold, mean spirited and rude I will walk out before I even step inside.Ever suffer the loss of your life Lisa....I think not.'),(1264,207,5,'Doctor Capaldini is by far the best PCP I have ever had .

I called Medical One 3 days in advance to make sure the prescriptions had been called in. I was told they were. An email was sent to confirm.

She ended up prescribing me something different which did not work.

I had insurance through BCBS but did not have a ProviderPCP & was not sure where to go so I looked them up on Yelp, saw some good ratings & reviews and decided to give them a try. This was my experience.It was a horrible choice & a regretful terrible route to have taken. A sorely poor choice I made to give in to OneMedical. It was almost like jumping through unnecessary hoops or taking a pointless detour to access medical care. They were very quick to sell me the Membership & did everything they possibly could to convince me to join, & sell me their services. They wanted that money  $150 for a Membership. They were advertised perks such as on time appointments, a stylish waiting room, & they seemed very keen to have me. From the moment I rang them, I felt as though I was being sold something, it was like ringing up an exclusive health spa or Gym. They were fabulous on the phone & sounded so exclusive & glamourous. It was JUST like being sold a Gym Membership, or calling in after seeing an exclusive Advert on QVC with the Agent waiting right next to the phone prepared with a script. Walking in to their office was like visiting an exclusive health Spa, or Real Estate Office.. It felt fake, like it lacked authenticity, it absolutely did not feel like a doctors office.After visiting reception & paying the 150, I was sat down at a computer where I would pick out my PCP just by looking at faces, a brief summary about them & their qualifications, a guide with their location of officeclibnic based on neighbourhood preference & convenience. Then there was the Membership Fee, OF COURSE, which they insisted I pay before they would provide service. A Lovely Membership Fee  only $150 to join & become an \'exclusive member\'. Just as if I was joining a Gym indeed! I observed a few things right off the bat. First the staff at reception were not dressed appropriately at all, certainly not for the Medical Field. They looked like they were working at a H&M, Forever 21, or some Health SpaGym sort place  they had pearcings, crazy hair, and looked casual, cool, though quite informal. They ought to have been wearing scrubs, a uniform, name tags, and something a bit more presentable, which is what I would have expected that being they are a Medical Office. But it seemed ok because of course One Medical is not your typical Doctor indeed. I selected a female PCP cos I felt that I\'d work better with a woman. She looked lovely on the computer screen but even after I chose my PCP when I went in to see my selected PCP she wasn\'t even the person I had selected! It turned out the PCP I selected was on Maternity Leave, & I wasn\'t even notified at the time I signed up! A Nurse Practitioner saw ne instead Nurse Tatum I believe  I didn\'t even recognize & her appearance made me feel very uncomfortable. She was dressed more like a Bank Teller or Real Estate Agent, she had no name tag, and wasn\'t even wearing a white coat or Medical Attire. It made me feel uncomfortable, like I was in the wrong place, and was not what I had expected. As for the medical component, I was incredibly ill with a cold when I went in I knew exactly what kind of Medications that I needed cos I had empty bottles from Meds I had previously taken that I was prescribed. I had a sinus infection & needed refills on a few medications I had previously been taking which was the reason for my visit. I was unwilling at the time to compromise, I just wanted to feel better, so out of desperation I went forward with paying the $150, despite all of these observations that had indeed turned me off. I accepted the fill in Nurse Practitioner that had called my name instead of the Doctor that I had chosen on the computer. The medications she prescribed me were not what I was seeking or had wanted. I only got 3 out of the 5 that I had requested & for my Sinus infection instead of prescribing me antibiotics she told me to go buy some nasal saline pot from Walgreens! Absolutely absurd & ridiculous! i should have just gone to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care. I was so horrified that I never followed up with her or did anything. I was so displeased that I never even went back, but of course I got lots of bills in the mail! I feel like One Medical Group is geared towards a specific type of cliental, & turn their back on others needing more specialized care. They are definitely exclusive & not open to just everyone, which is one of the reasons they sell themselves with a Membership. I have since moved on to UCSF & I\'d recommend going with CPMC, Kaiser, St FrancisMarys or even SF General instead. I would not recommend One Medical Group to any of my colleagues.'),(1337,209,1,'Aileen Kucsera is such a terrible disappointment to One Medical. If you must go here, make sure to request to not have her. She has been, without a doubt, the crudest professional I have ever had the displeasure of conversing with.

The whole same day appointments that start on time promise may technically be true, but there\'s a lot of gray area included in that statement. Take my experience today. I wanted to see my doctor in the financial district for what\'s likely a small issue. Well, his next availability is August 25th  one month from now. Ok, what other doctor is available sooner? Well, I could see an MD in Burlingame today. Or maybe Berkeley. Or Greenbrae is the other option. Lovely places to visit, but not exactly what I had in mind in terms of convenience. Given this, I keep asking myself, Why am I paying that extra $150 \'fee\' every year to stay at One Medical? I mean aside from the neato iPhone app and midcentury styled furniture in the waiting rooms?I hope others ask themselves this question before deciding to cough up the annual fee every year.'),(1340,209,3,'One Medical Group has a shocking policy where they might send you a very large bill for an office visit if you do not pay the much less expensive fee out of pocket and go through insurance. In my case, the receptionist said nothing to me at all about this possibility. Instead she suggested that I have them bill my HSA account directly instead of my paying my deductible that day. I said OK. Next thing I know, I receive a $500 bill for my 15 minute office visit that should have been $150. Calling the billing office, I get their standard explanation that my bill is so high because I didn\'t pay at the office the $150 it would have cost because I went through insurance. I knew my insurance would not cover this exam and, had the receptionist been more forthright, I would have more than gladly whipped out my credit card and paid the $150.On a positive note, the Office Manager is now working diligently to resolve this misunderstanding. However, this policy does remain and I advise unless absolutely certain your insurance will pay paying out of pocket at the time of the visit to avoid this sticker shock.'),(1341,209,5,'One Medical Group!

Prompt friendly service Easy to renew prescriptions, make appointments, renew prescriptions and see my history of visits  and lab results: all on line  no phone calls necessary Very responsive staff  if I want a receipt emailed they get it done. Minimal paperwork. Once things are online they do not require a lot of information when I have repeat visits. i.e. other places hound you to fill something out or show a card. Quality support staff.

I\'d rather not have someone who is burned out working on me. Good magazines in the lobby!  Remember the stacks of old magazines that look like they have been read a thousand times by small children with sticky fingers that you found in the big box hospitals?

I think the focus on customer service & their use of technology website, app are what makes One Medical a true gem in the industry and an innovative company. They streamline the process if you need an appointment by giving you access to the calendar of all the doctors in the area, and you can even get a prescription written for you via email if it\'s minor. This allows for a myriad of possibilities, and the likelihood of getting an appointment when you need it often dayof or the next day is actually a possibility. Most other Medical Companies I have dealt with are extremely inefficient with this, and do not pay attentioncare about the patient\'s needs. OM\'s email support team is always onpoint and punctual. I\'ve had nothing but great experiences with One Medical. Like everyone has said, the yearly fee is worth every penny.The only downside is that the sheer amount of people on staff does make it a doubleedged sword. One thing I would recommend is making a relationship with one particular doctor or smart PA if you can they do not all know what they\'re doing, and some will judge you or make assumptions about you. The amount of doctors available is appealing but it can be hard to get someone to truly understand not judge you for what you\'re feeling.'),(1343,209,5,'I love One Medical.

Also, access to a wide range of doctors and nurses for various specialties, and offices all over the city if you\'re often trying to fit in a visit between client visits in random neighborhoods.Can honestly say they have gone out of the way to make my life better over the last 3+ years.

Ironically enough, my main issues are the exact items they seem to dote themselves on as being different.Sutter location:Upon joining One Medical, I was told that email is the preferred method of communication with the providers, yet don\'t receive responses to emails until about a week or more after my emails and when they do respond, they simply are saying to feel free to keep increasing the dosage of medication. I\'m wondering if they simply have email response templates. I\'ve had prompter responses and more personalized care from both La Clinica and the Berkeley Free Clinic.While the delayed response and lack of addressing my specific issues were disturbing, I was not ready to quit them just yet...until this morning. I emailed Dr. Mary Lowen yesterday, letting her know I thought I had a sinus infection. Given the week or more response time to my previous emails, I thought I would call as well to follow up. When I called, I spoke to a very informative and courteous member admin, Brandon. Brandon let me know someone would be calling me to prescribe antibiotics and confirmed my preferred pharmacy.I received an email from them instead, with links to blogs about sinus infections. I responded to the email saying I am requesting antibiotics, not links to blogs. I was told by Phebe Kiryk that they would not call in the meds. She went on to cite recent trends in treating individual symptoms of sinus infections. I let her know that I was already sick, going on 2 weeks, and need MEDS, not data points. She told me that I would need to make an appointment to come in and be qualified for meds. I let her know I had gone home sick from work, and would not be schlepping out into the city to pay a copay, be seen, and MAYBE be given meds. My concerns were met with more robotic responses: Research shows that antibiotics don\'t always work as well as we used to think they did!!! No sense of urgency was expressed at all, and my concerns to advocate for my own health were discredited by Ms. Kiyrk\'s seemingly ambivalent coined responses.

When I went out to pay my copay, I was told that it would be $100 usually, but since I was a new patient, that would be $150. I balked, because a couple years ago I paid $140 for an uninsured appointment with CarePractice that was twice as long, included tests, and sent me home with medication. The receptionist told me sweetly that of course they could try putting it through the insurance, but there was no way of knowing how much it would cost then, except that it would most likely be considerably more. Probably $300 to $500. Or I could pay $150 now. Let me make sure I understand you: I have to give you $150 now or you are going to charge me an unknown fee, probably somewhere between $300 and $500?

I get on the phone too, but my hands are shaking, so I\'m still winding my way through their automated system when the receptionist comes over and shows me a figure. It\'s $789 She explains this is the highest the insurance company pays for that code, and it could be as much as that. In other words, I can give her $150 now, or find myself with a bill for $789 later. Take it or leave it.The insurance rep, when I finally get through, gives me a guestimate of $78.68. This sounds a lot more reasonable  I realize medical care is not cheap, but a $300$800 range for chatting with someone for 15 minutes is pretty crazy. There is no way I would have come in if I\'d known it was going to cost that much. Apparently, I\'m not the only one facing this problem. There have been several disagreements during the half hour I\'ve sat here with patients telling the receptionist that their insurance companies have told them that they shouldn\'t have to be forking over these large sums in the office, that One Medical should be billing the insurance companies. The receptionist always sweetly insists that they pay.Eventually, I call my wife who comes over and bails me out by telling them we\'ll just put it through the insurance company and work it out with them if the charges turn out to be outrageous. But I still leave the office in tears. There\'s really no reason, IMO, why I should have to choose between forking over $150 for a $78 procedure immediately or face a bill of several hundred dollars. I gather the reason why I was pressured into making a decision on the spot, without access to information or time to think it over, is that it\'s easier for One Medical to get money that way. I can\'t stop comparing my experience here with the one at CarePractice, where I was handed a binder upon arrival that very clearly spelled out all the procedures available and how much they cost. In fact, they put their fees right up on the web, for everyone to see: carepractice.comfeesThey also don\'t charge a $150 annual fee. I didn\'t mind paying the fee when I signed up yesterday.

This was the only reason why I paid the price for conveniences of walking distance. Yea, I know, that\'s crazy but this is SF, everything should be a block or 2 away from where your at.After going several times, I can actually say, my money was well spent.

I was pretty confused over the med\'s I had to take and needed to read through what was required...step by step: I can refill my prescriptions online without having to beg for more refills my doc knows I need them to survive: I let them do the work for me with referrals to specialty doc  that\'s a true diva move hereSo, if your feeling dizzy, go seek a doctor here. If the membership is making you dizzy, don\'t fret, it\'s worth it because your getting tip top notch care and excellent customer service.

So I call One Medical about this, they say they will research it and get back to me. No one gets back, you get the same bill again in the mail.

I said, you don\'t know what you\'re billing me for, and you\'re asking ME to figure it out?Then finally they apologized for billing me incorrectly, but I really wonder if they would have caught that if I just paid which I likely would have done because I\'m busy.

I walked out of here with a spring in my step, I was so utterly thrilled with the whole experience.My coworker had told me about One Medical Group\'s system  you pay a yearly membership fee $149, and then can utilize any of their SF clinics. Sounded unusually easy. See, like most 20something yearolds, I don\'t go to the doctor to check on my health...I go to the doctor when I\'m on the edge of death, desperate for drugs and educated answers. And as we lax youngins know, doctors don\'t like lastminute appointments. In fact, I have always ended up in Urgent Care because it\'s easier than begging my doctor to squeeze me in.But with One Medical Group\'s snazzy, patientoriented setup, the minute you have symptoms or a week after you\'ve been suffering from some unknown infection you can just hop online to check available appointments, book it, and you\'re good to go. I booked an appointment the very next day! They have multiple clinics in SF, and the office atmosphere feels so clean, modern, and stylish  totally unlike those gross, sterile, lifeless doctors offices we\'re used to. They\'ve got sleek furniture, stacks of cool mags, and...get this...fabulous music they were playing Lykke Li, Beirut, and The Knife during my visit  where the hell am I? This is too good to be true!Ok, but I haven\'t even gotten to the good part yet. The doctors! I picked my doctor, Amber, online, based on nothing except the fact that she looked nice. And boy, was my intuition correct. Amber has such a calm presence, and really listened when we were chatting about my medical history, concerns, etc. I felt immediately at ease, knowing I could be totally honest and that she was actually paying attention to what I was saying. So undoctorlike. In fact, everyone here from the receptionists to the lab techs to the nurses are super cool, and they seem like they actually enjoy their jobs. That\'s the key difference.I got my lab tests emailed to me within 4 days. Everything was so streamlined, efficient, and hightech that I\'m almost excited to have an excuse to go back almost. This is what health care would be like in a perfect world. See for yourself!'),(1357,209,2,'I do love the One Medical concept and I really, really like my doctor so I am sticking with them and him, but I had a not so great experience with the billing department. First off, you should know that if you have a highdeductible plan and you haven\'t met your deductible, One Medical gives you the option to pay $100 for any standard office visit on the day of, rather than bill the insurance company, but that $100 does not count toward your deductible. I had a few appointments in 2013 and when I went to leave, I was not asked to pay the $100 and instead was told okay, you\'re all set so I figured they somehow changed their policy. Nope. Granted, I should have asked about it and admittedly I did not. One Medical ended up billing my insurance for 4 different office visits and a few months later I received a bill in the mail from OM for around $1,000. I called them to see what was up and what it boiled down to was that they sent claims to the insurance company and whatever the appointments were for weren\'t covered, so basically I am paying $600 $1,000, minus the $400 for the visits as a penalty for the inconvenience of sending claims to insurance that didn\'t get paid. I can understand charging some kind of administrative fee for the trouble, but it\'s pretty draconian to charge that much over the $100 payontheday option. I called to complain that this cost was a little excessive so they agreed to knock down the bill a little, which was cool of them, and I agreed to pay some of it, which I did. At some point early in 2014, after payments had been made, I was told that the entire bill had either been waived or paid and that no further amounts were due. But at a recent office visit, the front desk person said I had an outstanding balance of $300 and change. When I told her I thought everything was settled, she said she\'d check with billing. Billing called me today and said that the amount was due and when I said that the last conversation I had with billing ended with them saying that we were square, the response was sorry, there\'s nothing we can do about it at this point but we can set up a payment plan if you\'d like. Super annoying. The girl from billing was very nice about it, but I\'m pretty pissed about having to fork over more money when I thought the bill was settled.So five stars for my doctor, five for the one medical experience and two stars for billing  nice people, but not so nice penalties for denied claims.'),(1358,209,4,'Despite my carefree hippie wanderlust intentions  I worry too much.Especially when it comes to my health.I am constantly convinced I have some sort of ailment which involves me spending waaaaay too much time researching my so called self diagnosed disease online until I can\'t sleep  which in turn often really does make me sick.It\'s altogether not a very attractive or healthy way to be.

I spoke with Corinne, who\'s job is customer quality assurance who apologized and acknowledged she didn\'t know why the ball got dropped and my prescriptions weren\'t filled. She said she\'d personally take care of it.  Now, I just spoke with Amanda who said it STILL hadn\'t been filled and had no reason why. This is three weeks of totally unacceptable behavior for a medical provider.  Unfortunately I have no health insurance and must order from Canada... with a couple week\'s lead time.

Real concierge medical practices often cost upwards of $500 a year for membership, and offers services like a doctor being on call after hours, responding to your emails, etc.One Medical claims to offer all of this for $149 less if you have a coupon or are referred by a friend who has a coupon, with a snazzy office to boot. Surely, they\'re cutting corners somewhere, right?They are.Let\'s start with the promise of email access to my doctor. My doctor used to be a Dr. Singh at the 110 Sutter office. Over the course of my 1st year of membership, I emailed Dr. Singh 3 times. I received 1 response over that time, and it wasn\'t from Dr. Singh, it was from a physician assistant who works at One Medical. So strike one  you don\'t truly have email access to your doctor.Second  continuity of care? Dr. Singh left One Medical with exactly 1 week\'s notice. 1 week\'s notice! After being my primary care physician for 18 months, I got a mysterious email stating he was leaving One Medical at the end of the week to pursue an interest in corporate health. Log in to the website and find another doctor... that was his advice.My prediction is that One Medical will eventually farm out everything to inexpensive PA\'s and nurse practitioners, and you won\'t be able to see a doctor. That\'s already pretty much the case. I since moved to a PA after Dr. Singh left, as it\'s hard to schedule a visit with an actual MD. Not that I don\'t think PA\'s are capable of most of what an MD does, but sometimes you want to see a doctor, and One Medical used to provide those...Nonetheless, I\'m still giving them 4 stars I\'d love to give them 3.5 but that\'s not an option because: a lot of other clinics in town will force you to see a PA rather than an MD it\'s an industrywide thing, you see, to save on costs, and being able to make appointments online AND request prescription renewals online is worth the $149 annual fee.Just don\'t buy into all the hype, because as with any other deal, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

He\'s one of the few physicians I\'ve encountered who\'s not an a clock. He\'s also incredibly conscientious and attentive. I had some anomolous blood test results a year ago. The cause was not immediately apparent. But he worked through the differential diagnoses and referred me to an worldclass hematologist, who concluded that the anomolies were benign. Huge relief.

Sadly, had this office shown as much care for patients just in general as they do for Yelp reviews, I might have been one of those 4  5 star reviews. You can see the response to my review.Your statement of A network of care devoted to you is laughable. Not sure what you are devoted to, but it certainly wasn\'t to my care, health or well being. And while we are at it, I decided to poke around a little more.The front desk specifically stated that Dr. Gatpolintan was NOT accepting new patients, which is part of why I would have to wait 2 months to get an appointment. Yet, on your Yelp page, you have a BOOK APPOINTMENT button that links to the office website which states on the front page  HIV Disease Specialist Accepting new patientsInfectious Disease Board CertifiedAccepting new patientsInternal Medicine Board CertifiedAccepting new patientsCopied from your very own websiteIt gets even more amazing. While my lovely incompetent at the front desk is telling me I can\'t get an appointment for two months with as much empathy as a crocodile taking my leg off, I can go on this same site and book an appointment WITHIN TWO DAYS !!!!! WHAT THE HECK ?!?!?  Guess had I known, I would have just gone online to seek an appointment  tis the way of the world now. I am sure your Facebook or social media outlets show more empathy than Ms. Incompetent that I had to deal with over the phone. So... what am I missing here? I would love to cry discrimination, but since my dear incompetent from the front desk did not even have my name and we had never met, I can\'t say that. Unless she has some serious magical powers to see me over the phone. How is it the website says ACCEPTING NEW PATIENTS and I can actually book an appointment within days and yet, when a patient who has been assigned to the office for over 12 a year calls  they are told otherwise and asked to wait 2 months to see a doctor. Maybe it\'s just me, but when the average person asks to see a doctor, its usually not for a planned sickness two months away unless I am preplanning for the Giants Next championship and need that good ole doctor\'s letter  two months out!How is it you take my review seriously, however your front desk or your office did not take my care as seriously  even after mentioning my health condition and the fact that I was seeking continuity of care.I have experience working in the healthcare industry, and without leaking out some crazily guarded trade secret, I can state on here that as a member of a PrePaid Plan or PHP as they were called, your office was paid a monthly fee whether or not I was in there. That knowledge alone and the fact that I had been assigned to this office for a number of months should have prompted a bit more empathy towards my case  or any other patients\' case for that matter. Your response and offer of assistance is like medicine after death pun intended. Sad that the only time initiative was shown was when a complaint shows up. I stand by my review, and I stand by my decision where I have now not only changed my physician\'s office but also my HealthPlan. I will take my business elsewhere as they say  so you now have lost a patient and the HealthPlan has lost a member and guess what  that also means my recommendations of lack thereof to any acquaintances will be along the same lines.'),(1390,211,5,'Dr. Gatpolintan is by far the most welcoming and comforting doctor that I have had. He was generous enough to spend a considerable amount of time with me. He is patient, professional, and very friendly. I am very happy to have found this doctor so close to where I live.'),(1391,211,5,'I was sure I had already written a review for Dr. G, but I guess not.I will keep it short and to the point; hands down the best doctor I could have ever wished for, have ever had, and the last one I ever want!'),(1392,211,5,'Dr. G is an outstanding doctor who truly cares about the overall wellbeing of his patients. I\'ve been seeing him for the last 3 years, and here are just a couple of examples of how I feel like he\'s gone above and beyond for me: 1. I first started seeing Dr. G when he was practicing at HMII. Right before HMII went under, Dr. G did a small, inoffice procedure for me, which unfortunately became infected a day or two before Dr. G left HMII. I managed to have a followup appointment with Dr. G on his last day there, right before he was set to go out on vacation. A couple of days later, while he was not only no longer working at HMII, but also out on vacation, he personally called me just to confirm that the infection was subsiding and to ensure that I knew what to watch out for and what to do if it flared up again while he was out. I was gobsmacked that he would make the effort to go out of his way and take the time away from his personal life just to make sure that I was okay. 2. I feel really comfortable talking to Dr. G about anything that might be going on in my life. He\'s completely nonjudgmental and as a gay male, it\'s been really refreshing to have someone who I can talk to freely and who understands the unique health issues in our community. I haven\'t always felt this way with my past doctors, but with Dr. G, every time I see him, it feels more like I\'m catching up with a friend, who just happens to be a doctor and can offer me some great advice to keep myself healthy.  3. I feel like Dr. G is super efficient with his care and won\'t prescribe any tests or medications that I don\'t need. When I first moved to the U.S. from Canada, I was kind of shocked by the goldplated care available to those with insurance, and felt like a lot of what other doctors prescribed for me may have been somewhat frivolous for a young, healthy person like myself. I feel like Dr. G is much more in line with my philosophy and will only prescribe medication and tests that I really need, which results in savings to me on my insurance copay. It also means that I\'m much more likely to follow through on his advice when he suggests that I really need to do something!Overall, I count myself as being extremely fortunate to have such a great doctor!'),(1393,211,5,'This is an update of my earlier review ... this keeps getting better. I saw Dr G late Friday afternoon. When so many people complain about their medical visits consisting of a tenminute visit with their physician followed by a full bill, today\'s visit the last of a day lasted over an hour. We considered all of my concerns, set up referrals when necessary, etc. Good luck getting your physician to sit still for that on a Friday evening.  While his office location isn\'t the most convenient for me, I think I\'ll stick around.'),(1394,211,5,'Dr.G is an amazing physician and I\'ve been going to him for years, back when he was practicing with Dr.Loftus at HMI. He really cares about his patients and is always there when I\'ve needed him. I utilized the my health website were you can send him and his staff emails. I can ask questions about things I have concerns with without making a appointment and if he feels I need to come in then I\'ll schedule an appointment. I like that he is so friendly and and I feel that I could talk to him about anything. He\'s so knowledgeable! I like that he\'s to the point and quick with his assessment and always ask my opinions in my care. He\'s always on time and I never sit long in the waiting area. I\'m usually always called within 5 minutes or before I have time to sit down. I have read a lot of bad reviews on the office staff at the desk but I\'ve not had an issue with them. I could care less if they are friendly I just want to see Dr.G when I go there. I usually do not have much interaction with the staff other than setting an appointment or pay a bill. Although my last few visits I\'ve noticed he now has a medical assistant that I think is phenomenal. I would highly recommend Dr.G for your primary needs. He\'s also holds a specialty in infectious disease if that\'s what you\'re looking for in San Francisco.'),(1395,211,1,'Chaotic, dysfunctional and frustrating are words that come to my mind concerning my experience with Dr. Gatpolintan and his practice.  All of this adds up to outright carelessness. I started seeing Dr. G. in the fall of 2013. At first, I thought things were proceeding smoothly, although I had to call in several times reach anyone other than an answering service to schedule an appointment, and that was the beginning of the unraveling of my experience with this practice.After being out of the country for a couple of weeks, I had pending lab work that I needed to get results of. Since I had been out of the country, I didn\'t realize that my appointment was scheduled on the first day of a BART strike. After going through public transit hell to get to my appointment, I finally arrived nine minutes late. After waiting around, I was told that Dr. Gatpolintan would NOT see me! I was frustrated and angry, since I almost always waited 20 to 30 minutes beyond my scheduled appointment times to see the doctor. Seems like an old double standard the patients\' time is is not worth all that much. Only the doctor\'s time counts. I scheduled another appointment time to see the doctor the following week. I was put into an examination room, and was told that Dr would be in to see me shortly. I was scheduled to see another MD, who I had NO previous contact with! This caused me to have to wait around for nearly another hour, and be shuffled around to at lest two other examination rooms before actually seeing the correct MD.When Dr. G. finally arrived, I confronted him concerning the previous appointment that he refused to see me. He mumbled something about the front desk, but they told me that his refusal to see me was HIS decision, and I believe them. After all of this, I received a bill from Sutter Pacific for NOT seeing the doctor, which was quickly and wisely recinded.I was also given incorrect information concerning a medication, and I asked that Dr. G. call me to explain the situation. That call never happened.I am presently seeing a nurse practitioner at a different practice, and I must say that I am receiving much better service and getting much better medical care here, than I ever received from Dr. G , who has a medical specialty..I also agree with another reviewer who stated that the practice screws up the most simplest things like getting appointment dates correct, leading to more confusion.If you are a patient who only needs to see an MD very occasionally, this practice just might work for you. But if you have an ongoing medical problem requiring multi office visits, this is the kind of practice that can quickly wear you down.'),(1396,211,5,'I give Dr G and his MA\'s 5 big stars! however the staff that answer the phone and check patients in only warrant 2 stars in my book.with that said;I\'ve been with Dr G since his days at Dr Loftus\' practice...Dr G has been consistently helpful and knowledgeable to my partner and I. whether it be simple blood test, getting in on same day, several surgerys we\'ve both been through or knowing what travel shots to get before we embark on out of the country vacations, Dr G has always been there for us maintaining nothing short of quality and top notch careconcern. we adore him and enjoy getting to see him....not many people can say that about going to their Doc. cheer to Dr G!!'),(1397,211,5,'simply excellent. whether i\'ve come to him for a physical or a specific issue, he\'s always been extremely helpful, and is very perceptive at diagnosing problems. i always feel comfortable talking to him about just about anything, and he is very nonjudgmental, and just a really nice guy who always likes to make friendly conversation and know what\'s going on in his patients\' lives.'),(1398,211,5,'I have now been seeing Dr. Gatpolintan for 3 years.

Unfortunately, he wasn\'t able to help with several other health issues. It\'s been disappointing since he  along with Dr Loftus during the time at HMII  have known me for 3+ years. I\'ve also had a frustrating experience with him and the billing department at Sutter. I set up a routine visit for a physical and pointed that out again when we met. He ended up billing it incorrectly and I received an invoice for more than 700$ for the visit and the blood work. It took almost 6 months, many followup invoices with incorrect statements, and phone calls to get the issue resolved  by simply rebilling my insurance company, who covered 100% of the cost at the end. If you have a cold or other minor things, the practice is perfectly fine. For everything else, I would go somewhere else. I ended up switching to another physician who has a lot of experience and was able to help.'),(1404,211,5,'I\'ve been a patient of Dr. Gatpolintan for a number of years and he has provided excellent medical care.'),(1405,211,1,'Dr Gatpolintan, is probably the most unethical if not dangerously careless physician I have ever known. His former partner Dr Loftus is a hero. As Dr Loftus left, we were put under the insecurity of a doctor who could care less about his patients. I saw Dr Gatpolintan in May he charged $546 for the visit, no tests taken. He was as compassionate as a crocodile, so this month, 5 months later, I asked to have my records transfered from him. AFTER 4 requests I am told he NEVER had them in his office. I filled a form to suggest upon the transfer from Loftus to Gatpolintan to have records sent over. Although that is irrelevant , he chose after seeing me and charging me, not to look at or ask for my previous records, nor tell me he does not have them. HE DID NOT CARE. He is literally uncaring. If in my records there is something that was of importance he would not care as long as he achieved his goal of charging $546 AND NOT EVEN READING MY FILE. I sat in his office thinking I was fully comforted that he knew my past. He did not. I therefore suggest thinking twice before risking your life with this man. You are literally risking your life.'),(1406,212,5,'This review is long over due. My first experience w Dr. Johnson was while ago. I made an appt. with another doctor in the office but she was running late and I waited for over 45 minutes. I kept seeing the doctor I made the appt with but she kept disappearing.  Frustrated, I walked out and confronted the doctor. She said she will get to me soon. I say not. I wanted to walk away. Thats when Dr. Johnson stepped in. He said he could fit me in right away. He was wonderful, took his time and got the ball rolling. Few years later, I went in again to see him. He ordered an MRI. To my surprise, he personally called me after hours to tell me the result and discussed the options. I was so grateful.

After a very difficult experience with a rushed, uninterested ENT doctor, I can sayalthough I don\'t wish my problems on anyonehe has almost made up for a harrowing experience.I saw Dr. Johnson about a sinus problem from an infected tooth. The surgery didn\'t take care of the problem, as he\'d hopednor did a root canal. The tooth had to be extracted. Many surgeons aren\'t interested or caring about patients who don\'t do well after surgery. They go on to the next brutal step without trying, or drop the case, or blame something else, or minimize the difficulty. Dr. Johnson did none of these things.  He worked hard to save the tooth. He made personal calls to my dentist when I was in the room. He showed me pictures on the camera of what was going on. And when it was clear I had to have the tooth extracted, he said: This is a mess for you. I\'m so sorry. Well...it was a mess. Yet his empathy, honesty and sense of reciprocal relation was healing for me.I also noticed that he didn\'t treat the assistant who followed him around with a computer like a cipher. He said he was lucky to have her except he would probably lose her because he thought she could go to medical school. He even had her help with a procedure.  This kind of respect speaks volumes, in contrast to doctors who treat people who record the procedures like secretaries from the 50s.  He is expert in his field and very modest. As someone who has been in the helping professions, as well as someone who teaches at the graduate level, I often take a very dim view of most people in his role.  Dr. Johnson is a superstar in every wayskill, cerebral intelligence, emotional intelligence, the ability to synthesize, and character.Sinuses are tricky and often as frustrating for the doctor as the patient.

With most doctors you feel rushed, he makes you feel like he has all the time in the world for you. He is very thorough in his medical explanations and calibrates the technical level astutely for his audience. The best way I can put it, is that in a short time with him you will realize why he is a superstar in his field. Research his curriculum vitae and you will see why everyone in the Bay Area who needs an ENT wants an appointment with him. Also his office is snazzy as could be with all sorts of high tech, like an inhouse CT scanner !. He also has a great sense of humor.

After 30 minutes, somebody asked me to go wait in the room, the doctor will be here any minute.15 minutes later, my phone\'s battery died because I had used it too much.

Maybe I\'m the only lone snoring review on here because it can be an embarrassing problem, especially for women. But alas, my pride can not outweigh what a great ENT Dr. Jacob Johnson is!I went in for an uvulectomy on Friday with Dr. Johnson. I will say, it took forever to schedule because the person who normally handles the appointments left and never got back to me. But either way, it was worth the wait.If you don\'t know what an uvulectomy is, it\'s when they trim that little punching bag thing in the back of your throat so that it doesn\'t vibrate when you sleep no, that little punching bag is NOT your tonsils. Dr. Jacobsen explained the procedure in great detail and gave me the option to be put out or awake. I chose to be awake because I\'m too cheap to pay to be put out and insurance doesn\'t always cover this procedure.I was SO nervous! Basically, they take a laser and trim down the uvula and any necessary soft palate tissue in order to create more space back there. I kept having these thoughts of the laser shooting through my skull and dying in the chair. Dramatic, I know! Dr. Johnson said I would be MISERABLE for at least 10 days. Liquid diet of smoothies and juices was going to be my new best friend for at least a few days. Well, I am happy to say that:1 Procedure was not as bad as I thought. Dr. Johnson made me feel very comfortable and said he was just going to give me a cute lil\' uvula. Lol! Granted, no one should know what the back of their throat smells like when it\'s being burned with lasers... but I didn\'t feel a thing and it was done in 25 minutes! Be prepared for times where the laser pops randomly because of the numbing meds. I wasn\'t and it was startling.2 Dr. Johnson purposefully only trimmed tissue from behind the uvula so that it would be more comfortable to eat and drink since there would be less raw tissue exposed. I think this has been my saving grace painwise because I only took the liquid vicodin the evening of the procedure and the pain has been tolerable. When I need a little something extra, I just take a couple Tylenol in pill form, I didn\'t die.3 I probably shouldn\'t encourage everyone to do this... but I couldn\'t do the smoothie diet, so I started eating other foods like room temperature soup and chewed everything until it was liquified before swallowing. No problems! I ate popcorn the day after the procedure. Granted... very slowly... kernel by kernel... chewed 200 times each... but still! No issues! I couldn\'t help it... can\'t watch a movie without popcorn.The pain was the worst in the morning, maybe because my uvula would get dry while sleeping. But I drink a ton of water all day to keep it moist per Johnson\'s instructions and am pretty comfortable all day. The pain is really only present when swallowing... not a chronic, constant pain like I was afraid it would be. Just feels like a sore throat... not like a canker sore, which in my opinion is way worse!I\'ll update once the swelling goes down to see if it was effective or not, but just wanted to dispell any ideas that uvulectomy\'s are intolerable. I read a lot of horror stories online before going in, so thought it was important to post one that wasn\'t so bad!'),(1414,212,2,'Like Dr. Johnson personally, but showedup on time for my appointment and left after an hour.

There were two young doctor\'s assistants present, one to record my symptoms and another to be the medical note taker, for lack of a better term, while the doctor was examining me.

This was not fun, but I put off the repair and plugged my ear with cotton every time I showered for years as my local ENT indicated it would most likely heal itself.That it did not do, so one day after listening to Dr. Johnson carefully weigh the pros and cons, I decided it was time to have the procedure. He had also seem some gray matter behind the drum and wanted to go in for a closer look to make sure nothing was the matter before he patched me up. I had the surgery back on 1011 and I\'m amazed to say I\'m almost back to preperforation perfection. I\'m due for my final followuphearing test soon, but based on how well I\'ve already recovered, I\'m confident this will just be a formality.Oh, one more thing to add: besides being a terrific physician, he has the best bedside manner of any doctor I\'ve met. He seems genuinely interested in what\'s going on in the world outside my ear canal, and I enjoy talking to him about my startup and his other endeavors. He even put my mom at ease when she was out here a few weeks ago to take care of me after my surgery. Now that is impressive! She is a consummate worrier and drives most doctors mad with her incessant questions. Dr. Johnson was patient with his patient\'s mom see what I did there? and sent us home with thorough postop instructions. He had his office call us to check in the next day and was quite responsive when I called back with the occasional question. All in a all, a great dude.'),(1426,212,5,'I was referred to Dr. Johnson & Dr. Schindler for a lump in my neck a few weeks ago. Turned out to be a tumor in the parotid gland, which required a parotidectomy. Lots of large words for a terrifying time with MRIs, biopsy\'s, and finally an overnight stay in the hospital after 6 hours of surgery. Through it all Dr. Johnson was amazing: before the surgery explaining all the steps and risks, during the surgery keeping my wife informed of the latest and keeping her spirits up, and then after the surgery with the followup appointments and doing everything he can to ensure the scar is minimal. His cheerful attitude and confidence were inspiring! With regards to his staff, they are excellent as well. Very professional, kind and helpful. Wait times can stretch a bit, but then again I would rather have a doc that takes a few extra minutes to answer every patient\'s question than push them out to keep to a deadline. So in summary, I would not wish a parotidectomy on anyone surgery of any kind sucks, but if you do have to go down that road I would highly recommend Dr. Johnson!'),(1427,212,5,'I\'ve had chronic ear problems out the gate and it was not until I moved to SF and met Dr. Johnson, that my problems were alleviated.

Doctor Johnson explains things in a way that it\'s easy to understand for us that have limited knowledge of biology and the human body.

He ordered a battery of tests which helped diagnose the problem, without which I\'d still be miserable. If only Dr. Sloane had paid as much attention and hadn\'t ignored my very real symptoms! Dr. Johnson was a breath of fresh air after dealing with a lot of mediocre medical care in this city. He isn\'t condescending, is open to trying multiple plans of attack, and didn\'t give me the brush off. Instead of trying to sell me his own patented nostril openers the way Dr. Sloane did, he tried to find out what was causing my breathing problems. In short, this doctor will take you and your body seriously.

Well, not Dr. Johnson,...........he took the time to explain to me the different options that we have I will not explain the graphic details. He then assured me that it wasn\'t anything serious.

I was called at 10am the day of my appointment and told that he\'s still in surgery and won\'t be able to see me at my noon appointment time but can I come at 2 instead. I couldn\'t and didn\'t really mind this  I understand that surgery can go over and they were trying to do me a favor by booking be asap in the first place so the person who called me, not the manager, rebooked me for two days later and I was okay with that. However, a few hours later I got a call from the manager saying they needed to move my appointment to an hour later. Me, dumbfounded and starting to get frustrated: Okay, but, I was JUST booked at that time by one of your associatesShort and to the point, the Manager said: Well, he is double booked and I don\'t want you to have to wait for an hour.I appreciate that but, um, well, perhaps you could have your staff not double book him like that? I offered gently because at this point I\'m pretty confused and annoyed.She snapped at me that it\'s his way of running his office and I\'d be happy to book you with another doctor who IS available.If you don\'t absolutely have to see Dr. Johnson, book with Dr. Andrea H. Yeung because she gave me excellent information that assuaged my fears and guided me towards an allergist to help with the pain in my ear.Only two stars because I found the staff to be rather testy with me  I was hung up on the first time I spoke to someone. All I did to deserve that was express frustration that she was asking me the same questions I\'d spent 20 minutes on their website answering. When I spoke to the manager about that she apologized and said I think I know who you talked to so that tells me that it must be a regular occurrence and not just someone having a bad day. You can imagine my surprise when I recognized the voice of the person who hung up on me as the one attached to the person checking me in for my appointment, a month later. I\'m a client service provider and if my boss knew I\'d hung up on a client, who called back specifically to complain about being hung up on, I would have been fired and I would have deserved it. *begin snark* She must be a really fast filer, or something, for them to have kept her on. *end snark*Overall, this was the worst doctor\'s office experience I\'ve had in the 8 years I\'ve been in the Bay Area, which wasn\'t really that bad but I\'ve been spoiled by stellar experiences  including 2 ER visits as well as a free clinic visit over by Civic Center.'),(1443,212,5,'I spent years cutting out activities and sleeping as much as possible to avoid the sore throats, but they never stayed away for long. In 2007 I had a terrible sore throat for 8 months that never went away, despite sleeping 12 hours a night and cutting out all smoking, coffee, and alcohol. Eventually it got to the point where I was sick 23 weeks out of the month, no matter what I did. And when I wasn\'t sick, I was just waiting to get sick again. So I spoke with my Dr. friend about my supposed weak immune system, and he asked the one question that changed everything: Is it just your throat that\'s always bothering you, or do you actually feel sick all over? Huh. I never even considered that there was a difference, but now that you mention it, I guess it\'s just my throat..  Well, he suggested I make an appointment with an ENT specialist and see about how to rectify the situation. The next morning I did a yelp search and found Dr Johnson.

She won\'t. Moreover, I am not sure Marie even exists.The only way to deal with our outrageous balance is, it seems, to simply send them a check by mail. Otherwise, I am guessing, it will go into collection after 6 months. This is basically an extortion operation they\'re running there.Stay away.

It seems the office can\'t be bothered to preauthorize on your behalf. Brown and Toland, my HMO insurance carrier, said this arrangment is against their policy as the patient is only responsible for the copay. So be forwarned.Further, the office insurance coodinator needs to find another line of work. Should you have any questions, she will return phone calls only at her convenience with an attitude some days later. I also discovered that the office posted some of my payments to the wrong account, which took someb time on the phone to correct. They never caught the error.I did speak to the Doctor about the office issues directly. His comment, You get some things right and some things wrong.

After bouncing around SF trying to find a doctor who was attentive and didn\'t make me wait hours beyond my scheduled appointment time such as Dr. Virginia Cafaro who did this to me several times, I finally found Dr. Feldman through a recommendation.I have had nothing but positive experiences with him. I have routine appointments every 3 months and he is always on time, and on the rare occassion that he is not, I am told he is running late and given the option of returning.  This was not the case with Dr. Cafaro, when I was first made to wait in the waiting room and then taken to the screening room where I waited for one hour with no one bothering to tell me she was running late her office is continually visited by drug reps bearing gifts, so I suspect that is the reason. Dr. Feldman is always friendly and attentive when I see him and I do not feel rushed.On several occassions I had to see him immediately and he saw me once on his day off at 7:30 a.m., and another time he squeezed me in after hours and stayed late.I have learned that doctors do not know everything. I\'d hate to find a doctor who thought he did. The fact that he might not have immediate answers to questions, or that he might have to look something up is encouraging. It means he doesn\'t pretend to know everything and would rather be safe than appear to look like a knowitall.

At first Dr. Feldman sent me off for an array of testsTilt Table, Echocardiogram, etc which all came back inconclusive. It\'s good to know my heart is in good shape, but...But, upon follow up with Gary he really hasn\'t offered any new ideas or next steps. What I did get was on follow up visits he didn\'t have a clue to any of our recent history and repeated his same exact test recommendations, Tilt table, Echo, etc from the beginning!I\'m not so naive to expect him to remember me or my health issues, but ANY professional should take 30 seconds to scan my chart for what\'s been done recently BEFORE talking to me. That\'s basic courtesy.The bottom line is after $10,000+ worth of tests I feel no closer to a diagnosis and have given up with Dr. Feldman on solving this issue.

I even had no problem disclosing personal or feminine issues. He was very attentive, friendly, quirky, and thorough, always asking if I had more questions. His medical advice seemed very neutral to me not pushing vaccines or drugs that weren\'t entirely necessarily. All in all, it was a very pleasant experience and Dr. Manese was my lifesaver for the day. I got my antibiotics within the hour there\'s a Walgreens pharmacy in the lobby of the building and by the evening, pain subsided *SIGH.I will definitely come back here if I\'m in the city currently am located in San Jose, but spend most of my week in SF.

There have been signs of this for years  he just about told me \'it\'s all in your head\'. His attitude was the main problem  and the few times I\'ve seen Dr Kapla himself I get the same impression.

He smiles, knows my name, knows my husband\'s name, knows my roommates, has REAL concern for how I\'m feeling, and takes the time to figure out a solution that works best for me. He\'s amazing.

He was very attentive and helpful  one instance, he even called my husband on his cellphone to our surprise because my husband forgot to get his bloodwork! I have never heard of a doctor personally calling a patient to remind him of what he needed to do. He told my husband, he will take care of him so he does not end up with the same condition as his parents. And his assistant  Martha  is wonderful, too.

As a scientist, I greatly appreciated it when he looked up a recent journal article to address a medical question I posed rather than just telling me my question wasn\'t important.

She called with the results as promised, but I was unable to call back and have an actual conversation. The receptionist is cold and apparently has access to all personal file information. I\'ve never had a receptionist be so thoughtless and again.. why does she have access to my personal file??? Shouldn\'t my resultstests be between me and the doctor? Apparently if you miss your results call, you have to schedule another appointment $$$$, how great for them. I never heard back from Dr. Newcomer and ended up letting it go.Now, I had xrays done for intense pain in my low back and hips.

The voicemail was long, complicated, and left me with no contact information to even ask simple questions. I need an MRI and I clearly have questions before I go in for that procedure.I attempted to get a hold of her this morning, and got stuck with the snippy receptionist once again. She repeated my results again.. isn\'t this confidential??? and asked what the issue was. I said the issue is that this is all a bit overwhelming, and I\'m essentially left to googling the large medical terms to try and understand what the heck is wrong with my hips?!?! Insanity!!! I got the \'you need a follow up appointment\' response because the doctor needs ample time to discuss questions. I asked her wouldn\'t that be the same as if I had been able to answer my phone in the first place. Her response... that is between you and the doctor. Oh is it? How can ANYTHING be between me and the doctor, if I have to pay $130 for each visit from my insurance???The level of humanity and service is appalling.

So while I like Dr. Newcomer, and I found her receptionist is friendly, there are communication problems.Her nurse practitioner also is a problem, I only saw her once, and while she was friendly enough she almost dismissed a serious medical problem because the symptom that manifested most was crying with little or no provocation which she told me was totally normal for a woman.So I would try to see Dr. Newcomer, not her nurse practitioner if I were you.'),(1574,217,2,'I\'ve had Dr Newcomer as my primary physician since moving to the city 4 years ago.

It was swollen and I was unable to bear weight.I went to Dr Newcomer that Monday, barely able to get into the office dragging my foot through the halls, practically in tears. She examined me, told me I needed to go get xrays, stay off of my foot and get crutches. She didn\'t advise me to use an ace bandage or anything. Just asked if I wanted any pain meds. I asked where I should get crutches? Walgreens, I think there\'s one on the corner that has them. Seemed odd but OK... so, I asked if someone could call for me to be sure they had them. Well the receptionist already left for lunch. Are you kidding me!!? You can\'t make a simple call to Walgreens for me so that I don\'t hobble several city blocks, further injuring myself, to get crutches? yes, I could call but there\'s no cell reception in her office and it seems like it would be a pretty easy thing to do for someone who already has the Walgreens pharmacy numbers handy.And guess what happened? The Walgreens I went to didn\'t have them. I was sent to another Walgreens around the corner to rent them. Got the crutches. Got a cab to the xray office. Did not hear from Dr Newcomer with results, so I called for them. She gave me the wet read before they get the final results, they get a quick read. I fractured a bone. She said she\'d call back when the final results came in, probably in a day or so.Didn\'t hear back. Called and the fill in receptionist took a message. I didn\'t hear back. I called again the next day. The fill in receptionist was rude and acted as if I was a pain  inconvenience. Sorry, just trying to get my results and find out if there\'s anything else I need to do!!

She diagnosed my Hashimoto\'s thyroiditis when other doctors dismissed my symptoms. She has given me tips for proven alternative remedies that have really worked for me. I haven\'t seen her in several years now because I consider her to be basically unavailable. When I have needed her urgently, she has not been available. The last time I tried to make an appointment with her during a pregnancy, I ended up at an urgent care facility because she couldn\'t see me for three days. Also, my experience has been that no one picks up the phone at her office. Perhaps this is symptomatic of or a reaction to the increasing cost of healthcare. In any case, I wish I could be still under her care, but I have given up.'),(1578,217,5,'I chose this Dr. without reading any Yelp! reviews, which is pretty much blasphemy in my book, but I forgot that Yelp! reviewed doctors.

And it worked out great for me!

No one likes going to the doctor and it can be stressful if you\'re there for a health problem that has the potential to be scary. But Dr. Newcomer is so easy to talk to and she really makes you feel at ease. She also knows her stuff  which is obviously a good trait to have in a doctor. She never judges you either which is huge. The doctor I had prior made nasty comments about my weight and made me feel horrible about myself and she always did it when I was in a paper gown, which made it 100x worse!.

Thankfully the reviews were right. As a new patient, I thought the process would take forever. The previous office I visited was a nightmare so I was especially aware of how this one would be. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was very easy getting an appointment. I called to make an appointment and was seen the same week. Their check in pad made it really easy and Megan, the NP was extremely nice and easy to talk to. I felt like I knew her instantly and she made me feel really comfortable. When we discussed natural remedies for my acne prior to seeing a Derm, she did not steer me to antibiotics but encouraged natural solutions given they worked for me. She asked a lot of questions and ordered me all the tests I wanted since it\'d been a while since seeing a doctor. The entire appointment was seamless and I left there really pleased.

They are concern about your overall wellbeing and not just the illness you are dealing with at the moment. If you work in fidi and would love a one stop doctors office that can handle your obgyn needs as well, this is the place to go!'),(1585,217,1,'I hate to give onestar reviews, but my experiences with Dr. Newcomer\'s office warrant it. In summary, my broken ankle went undiagnosed for five weeks because Dr. Newcomer ignored basic medical guidelines the Ottawa rules, and her advice to walk on it as much as possible led to a significant amount of pain over a long period of time, and drastically prolonged the treatment time normal is about 23 months max, I\'m at 11 months and still in treatment. Her office was unresponsive, unhelpful and unapologetic, and her and her office\'s lack of professionalism has had a negative and prolonged impact on my overall health and life. I was a patient for about two years, and was very happy with the attentiveness and speed of appointments. Total 5star experience.Last summer, I fell and injured my ankle. Dr. Newcomer squeezed me in, and examined me. Although my ankle was not able to bear weight, she diagnosed it as a sprain and gave me Vicodin, advising me to walk on it as much as possible with the help of crutches. She said it was a classic sprain, with no XRay needed but I could if I really wanted to, but she didn\'t think it was necessary, she said. As a result of all my previous experiences with her, I trusted her opinion and said if she didn\'t think it was necessary then I wouldn\'t do it. She gave a prescription for physical therapy, which I began after a week waiting period that she also recommended.As anyone with physician training knows not meI only found out later from another docthe inability to bear weight is one of the three Ottawa rules that indicate a possible ankle break and are cause for an XRay. The other two rules have to do with pain at certain locations of the bone, and I also had that.Two weeks later, I\'m still in a lot of pain and on crutches, and call the office to ask if I should come in, and the front desk woman says they can just call in a Vicodin refill. Fast forward another two weeks, I call again to say I\'m in a lot of pain I was out of Vicodin, my physical therapist said my injury seemed worse than a sprain, and I met another patient at my PT who had a similar problem with Dr. Newcomer, only with a refusal to order an MRI. They schedule an appointment, during which I get more Vicodin, and Dr. Newcomer says she\'s surprised that I\'m still nonweightbearing and am in such painshe actually said she thought I\'d be running marathons by now. She says I have two options: wait another two to three weeks and if it still hurts get an XRay; or get an XRay today. I voted for the XRay, which I did at a facility in the Laurel Heights area. That was a Friday.Monday and Tuesday I call Dr. Newcomer\'s office to see if the results have come in. The woman who works the front desk was out on vacation that week, and she had a temp working a few hours a day, who didn\'t return my calls. Since I worked in the same building, I went by and waited in the lobby of Dr. Newcomer\'s office on Wednesday afternoon to see if she had the results. Dr Newcomer wasn\'t very happy I was there what other choice did I have?, and went to the back room to look. She came out after a less than a minute to say she doesn\'t know where the temp would have put the resultsif they had even come inso I should wait for a call. At this point, I call the XRay lab myself and explain how I haven\'t been able to get results, so they immediately email them to me and said the results were sent to the doctor on Tuesday. Although I have no medical training, I knew enough to deduce that I had a break in my ankle and immediately took the results to my physical therapist, who called the doctor and said she wanted some sort of cast for me but would defer to the doctor\'s advice. On Thursday, Dr. Newcomer finally calls me and said she got the message from my PT, and she called and told the PT everything, so I can just seek treatment with the PT now. UHHH, WHAT? She is the DOCTOR. She was very abrupt and rude on this call, whereas I could have used a little bit of empathy or even an apology?.I walked on a broken ankle for five weeks, experienced a significant amount of pain, and am still in physical therapy 11 months later due to Dr. Newcomer\'s repeated recommendation that I didn\'t need an XRay . I am an understanding person, but there were multiple opportunities to correct Dr. Newcomer\'s mistake over the course of those 5 weeks, as I repeatedly reached out to her office. There are problems with the office staff, and problems with the doctortaken alone, maybe it wouldn\'t be so bad, but together they failed me. Shame on me for trusting Dr. Newcomer.'),(1586,217,5,'Dr. Newcomer has always great. She listens to her patients, always has someone call me back, and I trust her medical advice.

I was able to schedule a same day appointment, which was great. I went in, saw an associate and left with Nasal Spray. i thought, great, i don\'t have the flu and maybe this nasal spray will work.About a week goes by and my cough is 10x worse.

I let Naomi know the situation and ask if there are any appointments, but unfortunately, there\'s nothing till next tuesday. I proceed to tell her that my cough is horrible and i can\'t wait till tuesday. I informed her i went in about a week ago and all they gave me was nasal spray. I asked if they could prescribe me some antibiotics.  She says she\'ll email Dr. Newcomer and see if they could do anything. Of course, i don\'t receive a call back that day, or the next, or the next, or the next. A week later i receive a call from Naomi asking if my symptoms have subsided. Well Thanks.

This office is as good as it gets.'),(1592,218,5,'Nathan Becker is one of the most respected endocrinologists in the country, and for good reason. He is not only extremely dedicated, skilled and knowledgeable in his field, he possesses a rare gift not often seen with highly accomplished specialists: he truly cares about and connects with his patients. He LISTENS to what they say, and doesn\'t merely rely on test results to determine what\'s happening or what to do next. He embodies the principle of medicine being as much an art as a science. He functionally gives credence to thinking out of the box and puts the patient first when diagnosing and prescribing. Personally, Dr Becker turned my life around many years ago, and has kept me stable and healthy through a host of hormonal ups and downs. Working with hormones is a highly refined process and can profoundly affect so many things we take for granted. There is a direct connection between quality of life and a healthy endocrine system. For those of us dealing with this challenge, working with someone like Dr Becker is not just a lifesaver, but offers a level of health and wholeness that, unfortunately, is all too rare. Yes, he\'s expensive, yes he doesn\'t take insurance though his staff is very helpful with insurance matters. But he samples generously, and does as much as he can to make it workable for his patientsNote to Anonymous: I took Armour thyroid for years, enduring a lot of hormonal peaks and valleys in the process that had nothing to do with dosage, but the effects of the same dosage over time, which were not consistent. What I subsequently discovered long ago from Dr Becker is that, though Armour utilizes natural animal products in their formulations, they have been unable to standardize the potencies of the active ingredient in their medications. Thus, from batch to batch, one may get more or less of the hormone. Since then, new thyroid medications have come on the market that are more reliable and more targeted, and Dr Becker is utilizing these. Natural does not always equal true, better or more effective. Becker is definitely part of the Integrative Medicine movement, and has been for years.Thank god for doctors like him.'),(1593,218,5,'He is my guru and a miracle worker! I had a terrible run with a kaiser endocrinologist while trying to get pregnant. She refused to listen to me at all. I had all kinds of issues. I went to Dr Becker who figured out my issues within the first 10 minutes of actually examining me. Almost two years later I have a beautiful baby girl thanks to this man. He is worth every single cent I pay to see him. It is well worth it. If it weren\'t for him Id have spent tens of thousands on IVF. I\'m not freezing anymore. I have my energy back. I owe him my life. Love love love this man!!'),(1594,218,5,'Response to Rachel F.: Typically, people don\'t go to an endocrinologist unless they know they have an endocrinology issue. E.g., Why would I see a brain surgeon unless I knew that my condition needed one? Endo is highly specialized. Without a prior diagnosis of thyroid disease, diabetes, etc., or a referral to an Endo, I\'m not sure why you\'d slap down $800 to see Dr. Becker. I am grateful for Dr Becker\'s direct conversation. If I want a cheerleader, I can find one in the yellow pages under L for Life Coach. I want a doctor who will fight for my health. Dr Becker is this man.To All: Dr Becker is not insulting. Rather, he has a dry sense of humor as do I, so I get him. Once you\'ve been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder, then you see Dr Becker. He is not afraid to aggressively treat the condition. Metaphorically speaking, I haven\'t encountered a physician so far who has extended his hand in solidarity, fully prepared to walk this walk with me to help me get better. Dr Becker is amazing. But again, spend your money wisely and try to get your diagnosis first from your PCP. Thyroid diseases are easily diagnosed with blood work or ultrasound. Just about any physician can do that. But any physician can not TREAT the disease. This is what requires an endocrinology genius like Dr Becker.I have seen Dr Becker twice now, and I\'ve been on meds for a month. I\'ve noticed an improvement already so has my husband. At my first appointment, I felt totally betrayed by my Primary Care Physician who, after diagnosing me with Hashimoto\'s Disease nearly 4 years ago, was content to let the antithyroid Peroxidase antibodies kill the gland. Only then would he prescribe Synthroid. Many doctors will not treat Hashimoto\'s when you have a normal TSH level. I realize what I\'m about to say is an oversimplification. But too many doctors don\'t understand that with a disease like Hashi\'s, your thyroid is working overtime to try to keep the TSH level normal because the gland is under constant attack by the antibody. This screws up your metabolism just as hypothyroidism does.The cost to see Dr Becker is the best $1,300 we\'ve spent $800 for initial consult; he spent over 90 min. with me + $500 for the followup appt. It was simple to submit the bills to Anthem Blue Cross on my own and am awaiting reimbursement. Have your labs done through your network & this will keep your costs down, as well.When I first read through all the reviews of Dr. Becker, I kept saying, This is me. Now I count myself among the many who say, Dr Becker gave me my life back. I\'m not there yet. But for the first time in years, I can go for walks. I don\'t feel like napping all day. I\'ve just started on this path with Dr Becker; and at my last appt., he said We\'ll do this together. I finally have someone who gives a damn about treating this horrible Hashimoto\'s Disease which sucks the life out of you. Thank you, Dr Becker.[Edited for clarity on 7814]'),(1595,218,5,'Here\'s the thing: Yes, Dr. Becker is expensive, but for me, going to him has meant that I don\'t need to go to all of the other specialists I used to see as I was chasing my health problems all over the place and getting sicker. I saw him yesterday and he asked: Have you had any health problems, new medications, doctor\'s visits? And I just sat there and thought  No, for the first time in decades, no. Dr. Becker put me on total thyroid replacement a few years ago, and no other doctor would have, because my blood tests were normal. But I was as sick as a dog  50 pounds overweight, skin problems, annoyingly early perimenopause. chronic pain, arthritis, and fibromyalgia, severe depression, and chronic bilateral tinnitus.And I was doing everything right  eating carefully, exercising, vitamins, you name it. I spent many years in alternative medicine wasting my money and losing my health, and like another woman here, it was a therapist who looked at my symptoms and suggested Dr. Becker.I feel funny about this, because none of my other doctors caught this, and none of my current doctors would ever put me on thyroid, and certainly not on a total replacement dosage. When Dr. Becker suggested that I had thyroid disease, even though my blood didn\'t show it, I was really suspicious. But Dr. Becker was right  and he got me off of the antidepressants that were making me fat and onto Cytomel, and I\'m fine. I\'ve lost the weight, I only have pain if I eat grains or too high carb, I\'m not depressed ... he was right.Here\'s a way to save money  don\'t have his office do the blood draws or send out the lab work  or any imaging. You\'ll pay top of the hill prices. Instead, get a lab slip about a month before your visit, and do the draw and the labs in your own medical system. See him twice a year.

He was certain that I had to keep raising my thyroid dose until all of my symptoms went away. For some reason my body reacted terribly to the medication and after almost a year of the symptoms not budging, I moved on to a different doctor. He never once mentioned diet which is intimately linked to thyroid health or supplements or adrenals or gut health or any of the other things that have ultimately made the symptoms go away. It is wonderful that so many people have found their way back to health with his guidance, but given the thousands of dollars I spent on his services, I am shocked at his onedimensional approach.

I wish I would\'ve seen him years ago! I wouldn\'t be going through what I\'m going through now. He explained why doing RAI is still standard practice, but he doesn\'t recommend it anymore because a lot of people postRAI go through a lot of problems. THAT\'S ME!

My father travels to San Francisco several times a year from New Mexico to see Dr. Becker.For me, I would rather feel better and spend more money than entrust my health to someone who doesn\'t really know what he or she is doing. If you have insurance, call them ahead of time and see if they will cover part of it. I\'m telling you, its worth it...'),(1609,218,5,'Dr. Becker is worth every penny!

Every single one of them, excluding Becker, would either not test my Free T3 or tell me my levels were normal when they weren\'t. Other doctors wince when I tell them I\'m on cytomel and refuse to prescribe it to me. Without him, without that one extra little pill, I would not have graduated from college. They would classify me as having A.D.D. and give me something else that only made it worse. He has changed and saved my life. No one compares. He explains everything to you. I only wish other doctors were as smart as he is.'),(1610,218,5,'Dr. Becker brought me back to life.After seeing several Drs and I use that term loosely, Dr. Becker took a more scientific approach to my issues. He notes humans are not just lab values, if the blood tests say you are in a certain range and you are still not feeling like yourself, he digs deeper. When I first called for an appointment, they said it was a 6 mo wait. Given the ineptness I\'d encountered at other Dr\'s offices, it seemed it was worth the wait. I got a call for an opening on my bday and noted I thought he would be my present and he was. He both asks and welcomes questions and has the most efficient staff on the planet. And he has an office with a spectacular view so while you wait and you will wait you can enjoy the time.I trust him more than any other Dr. around. Period.'),(1611,218,5,'I have PCOS, and I just wanted to sayDr. Becker is the only doctor that has actually listened, and gone out of his way to help me out. I know he primarily treats thryoid conditionsbut he definitely looks at the full picture. I have seen 2 other doctors for my PCOS, and they completely disregarded my symptoms! One even told me that there was no way I had it!At times it can seem he is just whambamthank youmambut you just have to speak up and be really forward with him. I know sometimes it\'s hard to be totally honest with your doctorbut seriously, just tell him like it isand if you think he\'s not getting it, tell him again. My mom and I both have had total meltdowns in his office and he\'s always been extremely thoughtful and ready to help.Oh and again I would like to say  the office will not BILL your insurance in his officeit\'s up to you to do it.

I was getting worse and worse and thru yelp I found Dr. Buxton. All it took was the addition of a little Cytomel, and now I can go to a restaurant dressed normally and even show a little skin. I feel less out of it and even a bit more sharpminded. This practice doesn\'t accept insurance, you have to pay up front and then submit it yourself, but it is so worth it. Undertreated hypothyroidism means you are not operating at 100% and can lead to worsened health conditions when you are older.

My parents and siblings now live in southern California and they travel up to come and see him. He is the only doctor we truly trust, and we all feel that our lives are in his very capable hands. He is expensive. That is undeniable, and my husband and I have had several insurance changes over the last year, so the amount that is reimbursed keeps changing. One thing is absolutely certain, he is worth every penny and I happily pay it. What price do you put on feeling good and enjoying your life? He is the best there is, and that never comes cheap.'),(1614,218,5,'Dr. Becker and Dr. Buxton saved my sanity and probably saved my daughter\'s life. Our daughter entered adolescence and became so fatigued that 14 hours of sleep could not revive her. She was cold, anxious, demonstrated multiple anxiety disorders, had brittle hair and extremely dry skin. Her stellar academic performance became mediocre at best. We ran the gauntlet of primary care physicians, endocrinologists and every other specialist that our HMO would allow us to see after begging and pleading. My husband and I insisted that our daughter be assessed for hypothyroidism, since this disorder runs in the family. Our daughter\'s bloodwork fell within the wide range allowed by the HMO protocols, and our insurance refused tests that had been used to diagnose Hashimoto\'s Disease, which runs in our family. Exasperated and fearful about our daughter\'s longterm suffering, we made an appointment with Dr. Becker.The minute the doctor walked into the examining room, he asked our daughter how long her eyebrows had been falling out. He asked this without even an introduction. She burst into tears of relief that someone who could help her took such an immediate notice of her symptoms.With care, attention, professionalism, and a finesse of her dosages and treatment, our daughter has never looked back! She is nearly finished with college, now excels academically, is a fitness teacher, and a competitive athlete. We have arranged for our HMO primary care physician to honor Dr. Becker and Dr. Buxton\'s recommended prescriptions so that our prescriptions costs are covered by insurance. We have absolutely no regrets about any dollar spent in BeckerBuxton\'s office...but they aren\'t cheap!I am a teacher and often wonder how many seemingly apathetic children are really children with undiagnosed medical conditions andor nutritional deficiencies. Our daughter was labeled as lazy, uninterested, and as a kid going through a typical middle school phase. This came from my coworkers who were her teachers! She was none of these, but simply a girl who needed adequate, caring, and professional medical attention. Dr. Becker and Dr. Buxton gave her all of this and we are forever grateful!'),(1615,218,5,'Dr. Becker is the only one who would treat my 4 year old daughter who has hypothyroidism.

He told me that issue never comes back ok then... why did I have surgery again for the third time. Then he sent me toCPMC for an annual mammogram , where the radiologist told me I needed a biopsy in my right breast. Thankfully I went back to my old dr again who discovered my left breast had cancer the right was precancerous. A big miss by his recommendation. When I called him to tell him this he told me I was just angry at my diagnosis. No I was angry for all the other women who would and will follow in my footsteps to someone who made a mistake.

When I met with Dr. Roth, I was impressed by both his professional demeanor and his sense of humor. He cracked jokes and made me laugh, but still took me and my situation very seriously. He seemed genuinely interested in helping me feel better and clearing up the rash.He wrote me a prescription and took a sample of it with a cotton swab. The medicine worked after I finished the course. When the results of the test came in a week later, he clearly explained them to me over the phone and made sure he had answered all my questions.

He also realizes that if you\'re really worried about something that the FACT that you\'re worried about it makes it a problem  even if it\'s just a touch of hypochondria. He\'s not going to make you feel dumb for coming in with vague symptoms and trust me: I\'ve had a couple of doozies that I\'m now a little embarrassed about.And as weird as this sounds, I always feel like he\'s genuinely concerned with how I\'m feeling. True, he\'s no pillpusher and maybe the fact that he\'s older makes people think he\'s not up on the latest technology but if it\'s the former you want, go to LA.

Also, there is no follow up on next tests to do if the numbers are out of range, etc. Its more like they see you for that 20 mins and then you don\'t exists until you come back for an appointment scheduled by you.

However, after too many stories from friends who were misdiagnosed by OMG and had to go elsewhere for a 2nd opinion and actual treatment, I\'m now on a mission to make sure that nobody I care about goes to OMG. None of us are getting any younger, so why take chances? One time I went to OMG with a chronic cough. It was a really bad cough. I often felt like I was going to vomit up my innards. The person who saw me gave me a cough suppressant that did nothing except give me vivid nightmares and a list of herbal remedies I could try. She suggested I put a few drops of some plant oil into hot water at home and inhale the steam. If I wanted medical advice like that, I\'d talk to the receptionist at my local yoga studio. Weeks later, still coughing, I returned to OMG I hadn\'t quite learned my lesson yet. I was prescribed a steroid inhaler that actually got rid of my cough in less than a week.

I swear the receptionist did not say if I let it bill through insurance, it would charge around $400 versus if pay upfront for $175! I was told about that until I called and questioned their UNETHICAL BILLING PRACTICE. On the website, it says if someone claim not to have insurance, the charge would be $125$175.

I\'ve actually gotten spoiled by this, and only remembered how great it is after a recent visit to the UCSF sports medicine center great medical care, but I felt like my doctor was playing beat the clock the whole time. Another plus: they do lab draws on site, so if you have to give any blood, etc., you don\'t have to schlep off to nearest Labcorp.Finally, their administrative people are great.

Most of the available appointments are with physician\'s assistants, nurse practitioners or osteopaths. That\'s fine if you have a head cold or you need a bandaid, but if you have a real problem, that\'s completely inadequate. You\'ll find yourself making a completely pointless visit with someone who can\'t help you, only to be redirected to the closest appointment with a real physician  often a week or more away. The situation is so bad that the few times I\'ve had something serious, I\'ve had to visit whatever random doctor was available, in some distant part of the city.One Medical is clearly moving toward a factory model of medicine, where hypochondriacs can get nextday appointments with cheap, nonphysician providers for problems of little consequence.

It takes them days and days to process lab results that are available instantly.

The offices are beautiful.The second theme is that when people need medical care of any complexity they can\'t get it. The labs take weeks to get back, the coordination is nonexistent, and the substantive medical care offered by One Medical Group lacks depth. Basically, when people get sick they have to leave One Medical and go elsewhere.My experience over the last five years of working with them is that the complications and hurdles you encounter when you need care beyond an ordinary office visit outweigh the nicelooking offices.

The handful of physicians and nurse practitioners I\'ve seen thus far have all been very accommodating towards me and were very approachable.

While I was there I asked about my other test and was told that those results were not in, that the lab seemed to be backed up and that I should hear by the end of the week. Meaning 2 full weeks after giving the blood sample. Today, a couple days later I get a message telling me the lab lost my blood sample and that I will have to come in and get poked AGAIN and my results will be at least another week. These are routine tests! Thankfully I am not actually sick but come on! It will now take at least 3 weeks for an HIV test? I could have gone to a walk in clinic and gotten same day results. If I was actually waiting on some sort of diagnosis in order to get treatment I guess I would just be S.O.L. This is my very first experience with One Medical and I think it will be my last. I\'d hate to get stuck in the position where I was sick and really needed timely and reliable lab test results.  From reading other reviews it seems the lab they use is a constant source of frustration for patients. Why haven\'t they switched?'),(1701,221,1,'To One MedicalDr. Bowden:Try to treat people as if they have more than a middleschool education or have lived more than 10 years  Dr. Bowden\'s attempt to tell me about how life is  esp as a privileged person as he is  was quite rude...and VERY IMPORTANT: When someone is agitatedupsetstressed, talking to them in a very condescending manner as if you\'re more enlightenedin a much better place than the other person actually makes the person MORE UPSETAGITATED  I did NOT appreciate his tonelook of well, I\'m the doctor here, and anything you say I\'m going to smugly just look like Sean Hannity and dismiss your feelings...again, I have NEVER felt so disrespected and more  and the fact that Dr. Bowden is taking ZERO responsibility for his wordsactionscause of making things WORSE for me is sickening.'),(1702,221,2,'Met my friend at the 501 2nd Street location after her appointment.

After completely refusing to help her, I ended up putting the cost of HER appointment on my card so that we could get out of there!! As a longtime member of One Medical who has had varying experiences, I felt this was a last straw. I doubt I will renew my membership after this.'),(1703,221,1,'They have same day appointments... they just happen to be tomorrow. I want to love One Medical. I really do. They\'re so cool. I\'ve been a member, and a fan, since \'09. I just had one of the worst experiences with them that makes me wonder why I have been paying membership fees for so long. If you don\'t want detail, think of One Medical like IKEA. They look and sound like a really good idea, but after further experience you realize it\'s not all that great. If you want detail,... read on. I had something checked out by one of their Physician\'s Assistants, because everyone around me thought something was wrong. I was told by the Assistant it was OK, and was given great tips on preventative care to avoid such problems in the future. A day later I pass an MD, who upon looking at me, recognized I had a serious problem, and told me I needed to head back to One Medical ASAP, and request a examination by Doctor. I apparently needed antibiotics.The following morning I got to One Medical right as they opened, and asked for the first available appointment with an MD. I let them know I had seen a Physician\'s Assistant two days prior, and my condition was much worse. ***Please note that I looked like the Elephant Man at this point. It was clear that I had a problem that needed attention*** I was told that the first available appointment wasn\'t until the end of the day. I asked if I could wait in the lobby for someone to see me, and they said there was no point. That it wouldn\'t work unless they had a cancelation. I reluctantly took the end of day appointment with the hope that I could somehow get in sooner. By the time I got to my office, there was an email from One Medical saying that my appointment was with a Nurse Practitioner. I\'m not trying to hate on any roles in the medical industry, but I was told by a Doctor to ask for a Doctor. I contacted One Medical and began an all day process of trying to see a Doctor. I never did get to see a an MD at One Medical. The first appointment I could get was the following day. Out of desperation, I walked into an Optometrist office across from one of the One Medical offices, who recognized my issue as needing attention, and I received immediate medical care. I got a complete examination, and the antibiotics so sorely needed. The copay was the same as One Medical, and I didn\'t even have to pay a membership fee. I saw an actual Doctor! All in a fraction of the time it took me to get anything done with One Medical. The condition turned out to be serious. I needed medical care. To get the care from One Medical, I had to go across the street and get it from their neighbor. If you need care, I would suggest going somewhere else. With all the resources, and offices at their disposal, it\'s shocking how hard it is to see someone. If you don\'t need care, but just want a convenient place to do random preventative stuff, in an office that doesn\'t look sad, then join One Medical today.'),(1704,221,1,'So I\'ve had One Medical with Dr. Lee for several year and another doctor before that. Dr Lee was AWESOME best doctor I ever had and I was on several meds including thyroid and testosterone and I was feeling GREAT.Then they sent me a letter saying I couldn\'t see that doctor anymore becuase he was changing his practice. Gave me two other names to try which I did and they promptly took me off of meds I\'ve been on for over 7 years. No phone call no nothing and no change in the same exact blood tests and levels i\'ve had for a decade. This doctor just didn\'t get what the others had done also wanted to keep me from unfairly burdening the health care system. I pay cash for these medications so I\'m not even using insurance you idiot.  Plus this guy takes huge amounts of time and doesn\'t discuss anything relevant to health. I brpught up a couple concenrs  he just ignored it. So boom I\'m off everything....I could not even get an Ambien from this guy.

Yes, they do offer this, but this does not mean its the same day appointment with YOUR doctor or even the same location. I had a urgent care I needed looked at, and I had to travel to a distant facility.Just so people know, One Medical is not a hospital. They are primary care and basically just triage. For special care, they send you to other hospitals. My issue wasn\'t identified by my One Medical PCP. So they sent me to 3 different specialists, plus took urine and blood samples. I had to pay a copay for each specialist I saw and also had to pay for the blood testing and urine testing. My copay was $40 per specialist and the testings cost about $12. Also note, that each specialist didn\'t talk to each other. Some wanted to do their own blood testurine sample.After my company benefit renewel period came up, I switched to Kaiser because I hated jumping hospital to hospital, specialist to specialist. Kaiser was also the cheaper plan. They also do online appointment scheduling, same day appointments. My doctor\'s emails are faster. One medical would reply once within 24hr hours.

She talked like a valley girl and did not inspire confidence.

So overall, a three star rating  decent. Don\'t get the hype, but will continue to go out of sheer convenience. ps  and to Scotch B, who felt a need to comment on my initial review  Really?

I decided to try out Noe Valley Clinic based on my coworker\'s recommendation. I called at 1:30pm and they gave me a 3:30pm appointment. The key to the getting a quick appointment is the $129year membership fee. With that initial investment, you get access to MDs, nutritionists, physicians assistants, acupuncturists and more. You fill out all of your medical information online before you go so there isn\'t a stack of papers waiting for you at the office.The office has a great list of pedigreed health professionals. My acupuncturist, Jeannie Bianchi, is already in the practice so I can attest to her skills. Today, physician assistant, Sarah Maxwell, gave me some useful advice and quality medical care. In the future I can request prescription refills online and get lastminute appointments.

One Medical was recommended as a possible option. I chose Dr. Elizabeth Maier to try. I would not recommend Dr. Maier as a primary physician. At my first and last appointment for an annual physical, she was disinterested and impersonal, and seemed primarily focused on wrapping the visit up as quickly as possible. I was aware throughout the visit of feeling pressed for time. She was not interested in me as a patient. Among other things, she did not take any vitals. She asked me what my weight was, and then to weigh myself and tell her. She did not examine my eyes or ears. She did not test handeye coordination. To me these are basic requirements for an annual physical, and completely the responsibility of the physician. She had no commentsquestions regarding my medical history. She would not address questions regarding specific health concerns. At what was an annual physical, she communicated to me that I would have to make a separate appointment to discuss these questions. My interest in One Medical was that they purport to operate differently from most major medical systems, in that they are specifically focused on providing excellent patient care. Also, my experience of annual physicals, is that it is the one visit where it is expected and appropriate to discuss any health questions or concerns. I have never had a physician tell me to schedule an appointment to discuss one. Possibly this is just the way One Medical is structured.'),(1739,222,5,'A couple of years ago I changed my doctors office because I wanted to actually be seen at my appointed time and talk with somebody who was willing to talk with me as oppose to rushing me out of the door.

Somehow there was a glitch in the system and my doctor was not informed I had canceled the appointment...things happen right! It was both surprising and refreshing to get a call from my doctor, Dr. Elizabeth Maier. The conversation went something like this... Hi Maureen it\'s Dr Elizabeth Maier I noticed that you weren\'t able to make the appointment for your pap. I just wanted to check everything is okay. I was so surprised. It seems we are all busy running around with a million things to do. So the fact she was willing to take the time was amazing.

I have never had a boutique clinicdoctor in the past but so far I am loving it.When I got my last PCP assigned to me by my insurer I was really disappointed. He didn\'t ever show up on time, was super impersonal and planned on spending about 4 minutes with you before booting you back to the waiting room... I think that the reception people knew for about medicine than he did. He also was on vacation more than anyone I have ever come across.Needless to say that just about anyone would have been better than my last Dr. Imagine how good it felt when I read that there was a private membership clinic just 2 blocks from my house that was brand new and accepting my insurance?! I emailed a few key questions that were answered promptly, quickly paid my dues and called my insurance to change my PCP to Dr. Schecter.I had my first appointment this week and was blown away by how nice and new the facility is... I think it is about 6 weeks old my last guy was in a facility that was about 60 years old! There were magazines in the waiting room that I actually wanted to read but I didn\'t have time because I was in the Dr. office within 2 minutes of my appointment time. As this was my initial appointment there were some questions about any existing conditions and the whatnot. Also she talked to me about what I can do to change my health and I felt like she really listened to me instead of going down some medical check list waiting for me to stop so she could look up some HMO matrix and write a prescription. A breath of fresh air.I guess that I wanted to share how lucky I feel that I found a Dr. and a clinic that is going to work with me to make some big changes regarding my health.

Dr. Tan is able to look at nutrition, lifestyle, and a number of seemingly disconnected health issues and understand how they relate. He really listens, and is looking for realistic and achievable steps for us to take.I also really like going to a nice office rather than a hospital, if only because I\'m not exposed to infectious people.To top it off, I just received a $50 refund because they adjusted their visit pricing based on patient feedback.

Only positive experiences here... Dr. Blackman is marvelous.'),(1745,222,1,'I\'ve had an abysmal experience with this clinic. I was excited about the idea of the clinic, because they are near my home and I thought it would be useful to have a one stop place for most of my medical needs. I\'ve seen them now 45 times. They have wasted many hours of my time in the following ways:1 I set up an appointment with them to get some tests done. When I showed up at NV Clinic, expecting them to perform these services, I was informed by the receptionist that here is a piece of paper telling you where you need to go. The receptionist neglected to mention to me that the tests were done externally and that I would need to wait at this other clinic for 45 hrs to get these tests done. Nevermind the fact that I had to take time off of work just to go in and get this piece of paper directing me elsewhere to begin with. 2 I also did not get to see an MD for my yearly check up. They directed me to a NP. I now need to see an MD specialist, and I asked for a referral to a female doctor. I was very clear and straightforward about this. I went to see the doctor they recommended and it turned out to be a male doctor, thereby wasting even more hours of my life.3 When my test results finally came back, they did not call me or tell me. It was only when I called them about 2 months later did they tell me the results. Maybe their MDs are good. Who knows.'),(1746,222,5,'Superb. How refreshing to find a Dr. entering your info quickly into a computer rather than scrawling it by hand onto a piece of paper. That\'s it? My medical file is a pile of papers.

The receptionist is also very friendly!'),(1751,223,1,'This review is specifically for Jessica the admin and Dr. Wardwell.Where to begin, how about with absolute racket. Its funny that they call themselves Care, such a misnomer. They should just put $ Care. At every interaction I\'ve had with them, its been about more appts, more money, oh and by the way, THEY DON\'T TAKE INSURANCE. Many of their fees might even be covered by your insurance, but they don\'t want to do the paperwork.So seeing how its out of pocket, I wanted to be very clear about the cost up front. By phone, they told me $185 per visit, thats a discount since you found us on Yelp. They scheduled the visit for Saturday, the only day Doctor Wardwell was available. When I came in for the visit, I asked again to verify the price and the admin told me $240. I mentioned to her the discrepancy and she said, oh, thats our weekday price, its more on the weekends. I mentioned the Yelp discount and she said she could bring it down to $210. Ridiculous but I reasoned it was only $25 more. I told her I knew the test I needed based on two other phone calls with Naturopathic doctors and didn\'t want to waste Doctor Wardwell\'s time without having the results first, which were a 3 week turnaround by an outside lab. Doctor Wardwell took me back to his office and instead of a quick 5 min chat, it turned in to 25min with the same result, he recommended the same damn test. I exit feeling cheated that I just did a visit for no reason and no progress. And here\'s the kicker:Admin: Your total for today is $290, she says with a straight face. Me: $290!, why $290?Admin: Its says here your visit was of medium complexityMe: what does that even mean? Is that an actual line item, can I see it?Amin: noMe: a half hour ago when I came in you told me the visit would be $210Admin: okay, I can bring it down to $240Me: no, you told me $210Admin: okay, $210I left with a sour taste to say the least. 3 weeks later she calls to tell me my results are in and wants to schedule an appt. Not wanting to return, I said I was feeling better and would call if the symptoms resurfaced. Two days later, another call from Care, Dr. Wardwell would really like to discuss your results with you. Me: I thought I already told you what I wanted the other day. Admin: Well, he would like me to send you the resultsI\'m thinking perfect, then I can decide if I need a follow up visit.Two days laterAdmin: Dr. Woodward is in the office today sat and would really like to either set up a visit or he can speak with you by phoneMe: I\'m at the gym but can do a quick phone call in an hourShe calls me back in an hour and says: Hi, I have Dr. Wardwell right here, is this still a good timeMe: yesAdmin: ok, I\'ll pass you right over. The call will be 175, is that okay?Me: WHAT! $175 dollars? American? Definitely not!Admin: oh, okay. Is money a problem?Me: Yes, $175 for 5  10 mins is a problem, why didn\'t you tell me this an hour ago when you called?Admin: oh okay, I\'ll tell Dr. Wardwell you don\'t want to talk to himAbsurd on so many levels. First that she didn\'t tell me the price of the call beforehand and second that she made me feel like an ass for not wanting to pay a rate that is higher than any lawyer in SF. My two interactions with Care: 1st one I was scammed, the 2nd they tried to scam me again. Not kosher. In retrospect, any doctor who is right there and their patient says, yes money is an issue and doesn\'t get on the phone to discuss for at least a couple mins, doesn\'t give two shits about their patient and is purely money driven. To sum it up: Maybe there are other good doctors at Care, but there are a lot of good docs in this town. If you don\'t want to get totally fleeced and feel like a jackass for asking about the price of your out of pocket care, I would stay away.'),(1752,223,4,'Great experience with same day appointments and a nice receptionist.

It\'s how we handle our flaws that defines us though, and at least one doctor who is a member of the Care Practice team has failed to live up to the first tenant of medicine: do no harm.Every experience I had with Care Practice tells me one thing: the administrative staff there really does seem to care. They were polite and respectful at all times, and tried their best to help me out as another human being. My hat is tipped in their direction.But when two Care Practice physicians who had very little experience seemingly told me on my initial examination that I had a significant midabdominal gastric mass that needed a CT scan mmmm radiation!, I believed them. My condition could lead to that some day, yes. However, when the CT scan revealed specifically that there was no mass of any sort in my abdomen, it\'s not like they pressed forward to see what the problem really was. They basically ignored me, ignored the fact that I had spent time and money on the scans, and ignored the fact that I could still be sick.Okay, you wasted my time on the CT, put me through radiation, don\'t you think the least you could do is try and figure out what\'s actually wrong?The bigger problem comes with do no harm. One doctor at care practice had assumed the role of my Primary Care Physician... he had taken over two medical prescriptions I had been on for over a decade... and was prescribing them for me. Then, when I asked him to refill these prescriptions recently, he told me that he couldn\'t unless I came in to see him  a lie, at least by AMA standards, and by the standards of some 10 other doctors who had prescribed this med for me before at the same dosage.Right now, I\'m not doing so well in the money department  every bit helps, and I\'m about to be on Medical. I asked him to please just tide me over 30 days or even just two weeks until I could start seeing my Medical doctor. Ignoring the very dire warnings posted by the AMA, the Mayo Clinic, and every doctor before him I\'ve talked to, he seemed unphased by the fact that I couldn\'t afford to pay him to not go into medical withdrawl. He hung up knowing full well that his actions will cause me pain, suffering, and could lead to really severe sideeffects... all because he wanted some money from a person infinitely poorer than he is.I hope he sleeps well tonight. I won\'t be able to because of his lack of compassion. I\'m sure I\'ll be able to go to a hospital if necessary. More wasted time and money.

I went searching for a new office that I could pay directly. Being that I am an avid Yelper, I searched and picked this place based on the review.Just so happens you also get $50.00 off your office visit when you mention Yelp. I scheduled an appointment online using the website and headed down to Care Practice. So when I get there, it\'s a beautifully decorated office with cool books on the table. I checked in and as soon as I settled in, my Doctor was calling. Sad to say, I\'m really not used to fast service at a medical center before now. I met with Dr. Vinh Ngo, who checked me out and spoke to me about my poor little cold and sore throat. He wrote me a prescription for the medicine he did not have, but the others he gave to me and charged me for them. I was impressed! You just saved me another 45 minutes waiting around in Walgreens.I really enjoyed the visit. The Doctor was great, the receptionist was great. I was in and out with my medicine in less than 30 minutes and spend a total of $112.00 with my meds. How could one sick girl be happier than that? Care Practice is a great alternative to paying the big bucks for medical insurance. I hardly get sick and paying $112.00 is way cheaper than most monthly plan preminums.'),(1761,223,5,'I was referred to Care Practice by a friend who was a patient of Dr. Blackledge, in the beginning I only went for urgent care, but it wasn\'t long before I started going for primary care as well.A lot of people don\'t like the fact that they don\'t take insurance, but it\'s a trade off that works to everyone\'s advantage in my opinion, since dealing with insurance issues slows down and complicates things. I\'ve been going to Care Practice for almost a couple years now, and the first year I submitted my receipts to my insurance on my own, they provide all the paperwork to you, but I\'m a relatively healthy young person, and aren\'t even likely to reach my medical insurance deductible this year anyway, so why even bother submitting to insurance? If I were less healthy or needed lots of tests or surgery my situation would be different, but even still, the high quality of service, ease of making appointments, lack of endless time in a Kaiser waiting room for assembly linelike visits where you spend most of the time with a PA or RN in the treatment room before the doctor pops in for 10 minutes... I could keep going, but the point is that I don\'t stress about making a doctor\'s appointment anymore, don\'t need to schedule appointments weeks or months in advance, don\'t need to take off a half day of work to sit in a waiting room, etc. Another great thing is that they stock a lot of common medications in the office, saving the patient another uncomfortable trip to the pharmacy and more waiting  the people who complain about the pricing just need to ask for a prescription, that\'s what I do with the more expensive medications I want insurance to cover through Walgreens, but for more common and affordable drugs, that convenience can be priceless when you\'re sick. Dr. Blackledge even responds to email  I\'d never had a doctor before who did that.I\'ve also seen other doctors at the practice a few times, and it\'s been a great experience. I was sick once on the weekend and my only options were to go to the emergency room overboard at $1000+ and lots of waitinghassle or grin and bear it until I could get a weekday appointment. Care Practice offered a third option and I was able to make an appointment on a Sunday and went to see Dr. Zaphiris. I had never seen her before and was a little anxious, but I was able to get in quickly and easily, it made me feel so much better it was totally worth the weekend pricing, still a fraction of the price of an emergency room with such better service  it\'s always unfortunate to have a miniemergency like that, but Care Practice provides a better option than anywhere else I\'ve been able to find.And yes, like the other reviewers say it\'s a hip, clean, wellorganized office with great staff and a relaxing atmosphere. It\'s super easy to schedule appointments online too. A lot of the negative reviews are simply because they don\'t take care of billing your insurance for you, but most people can still get 5080% reimbursement for out of network providers, you just have to send the bill yourself. I also used my Flexible Spending Account dollars there last year, and then this year switched to a Health Savings Account since I don\'t hit my $1500 deductible anyway and have used that to pay as well, they do take credit cards. My employer is required by law San Francisco Health Care Security Ordinance, see SFCityOption.com to contribute to a Medical Reimbursement Account, and I\'ve submitted my Care Practice receipts to that as well, in the long run it honestly is not overpriced for me, the value is undeniable for my situation and circumstances.In my opinion, Care Practice is the way modern medical offices should be run, I\'m dreading the day I move out of SF and go back to institutionalized care.'),(1762,223,1,'I have mixed thoughts here.I\'d give them five starts for same day service and I can get in and out quickly.However, last time I was there they prescribed me a homeopathic remedy for my injured finger.Homeopathic remedies are snake oil and aren\'t regulated by the FDA.According to Wikipedia:The scientific community regards homeopathy as nonsense,[11] quackery[12][13][14] or a sham,[15] and homeopathic practice has been criticized as unethical.[16] The axioms of homeopathy are long refuted[17] and lack any biological plausibility.[18] Although some clinical trials produce positive results,[19][20] systematic reviews reveal that this is because of chance, flawed research methods, and reporting bias.[21][22][23][24] The postulated mechanisms of action of homeopathic remedies are not only scientifically implausible[21][25][26][27] but precluded by the laws of physics.[28]...This seems like a major deal breaker and a violation of their hippocratic oath.Specifically, by prescribing me a snake oil remedy, they\'re doing harm as I would have been able to receive real and genuine medical treatment as opposed to faux medical treatment via homeopathy.'),(1763,223,5,'Aaron Blackledge founder of Care Practice is a genius!

I called on behalf of person I was in charge of setting up ORT for. The price is unnecessary and sickening, it really is. Exorbitant beyond belief. Clearly the folks who run this place must know that the people who most need their help can\'t afford it. How could they not? They can say all they want how they offer a holistic approach to harm reduction and replacement therapy, when truly if you\'ve been around the block a few times, it is plain that this is a cash cow. Specifically CASH ONLY. That alone is bizarre. So, if you all want to serve your community, you need to do your job and make it fairly priced. A sliding scale would be a start. No amount of smudge sticks and talk therapy can make me think otherwise.

My first visit was over a year ago and I left feeling as though it was an average visit. However, today\'s visit was more than I could have asked for. The problem I thought I had turned out to be something a little more severe and humiliating. I saw Dr. Ngo and although the procedure was painful and uncomfortable, I feel so much better. I had been in so much pain the last couple of days that as soon as he explained what was wrong I burst into tears. He was kind enough to ask the receptionist to come in for moral support. She was very kind and did her best to distract me with conversation. I do not know how to spell her name, but you know who you are.

Anyways, as I started talking about the reason I came in, I started crying yes it\'s that bad!. Dr. Lewis was genuinely comforting and listened, never cut me off like other doctors do. With no med insurance, she went over best options for me along with price differences. Came home with retina really praying it works!She even went above and beyond when she took the time to refill my other prescriptions otherwise I would have totally forgotten about them.Overall great experience, atmosphere was so calming.

I have a BMI of 25 slightly overweight and eat pretty well, but when I said that, the doctor gave me five more minutes of the eat more veggies talk. As an aside at the end, he said there was a possibility I had a food allergy and to play around with diet. He also sold me on a $50 pill that didn\'t help with the gas.Result:After much experimenting, I found abdominal pain is due to gluten intolerance.

I couldn\'t afford a trip to the ER, and my boyfriend found Care Practice here on Yelp. They had great reviews, so we called first thing in my morning.First Impression:I started to love CP just through my interaction with Nicole, their receptionist, over the phone when I made my appointment. She was so professional and helpful, and told me about the Yelp discount they offered $50 off your first visit. She knew I was a student and helped make my visit more affordable.Upon Arrival:Nicole hadn\'t lied when she said street parking wasn\'t a problem. We found a spot quickly and didn\'t have to stress about making the appointment on time. The lobby is welcoming, modern, and very cozy. I absolutely LOVE all of the artwork, both in the lobby and throughout the office. This place has class and a lot of fun touches of personality.My appointment:I met with Dr. Alex Zaphiris, who was incredible. She was direct, wellinformed, and talked to me like a person. I\'ve been to Student Health at SFSU for the same problem countless times and not ONCE has a doctor there sat me down and told me about practical, nonmedicinal ways to prevent these infections. NOT ONCE. How hard would it be for them to look at my record and say, Oh? You have this issue a lot? Well, I\'ve seen this research on this one vitamin you can take.... This is what it feels like to talk to a GOOD doctor!They asked for a sample and after testing it, Dr. Zaphiris even brought me the test strip and walked me through the key to show me exactly what was going on and how she came to her conclusions about my treatment. I loved being so involved in the treatment process, because your treatment should never be a mystery!Dr. Zaphiris also asked me about myself so she knew I was in research, and would want to know more about the vitamins she recommended to prevent future infections vitamins she knew I could get cheaply at any health food store, not some product they were pushing at CP. In addition to printing out a health plan for me, which included a list of all her vitamin recommendations and warning signs to watch for just in case I needed to come back, she sent me an email attaching the research articles supporting the vitamins she recommended!! The way out:CP also has their own small pharmacy because, as Dr. Zaphiris said to me, The last thing you want to do when you\'re not feeling well is to run around all over the place. I was in and out in less than half an hour with meds in hand, on the fast track to feeling much better.

About an hour after I\'d come in, and 200 dollars later, I had had a consultation, lab tests done, and got my antibiotics comped! Color me impressed.

I will be honest, it\'s been about 1015 years since I have seen a doctor so I really didn\'t know what to expect except that I needed something now!I was amazed you could schedule online they were closed at the time I was crawling on the floor so that\'s what I did. Only problem was that I would have to wait until the afternoon this place is popular so book an apt asap. I load myself up with a hefty amount of ibuprofen, head over to Care Practice, and was greeted by the super friendly receptionist, Nicole I believe. I was offered a seat and a couch to lay down on but seeing that it took me most of the day just to stand I thought I would take my chances just standing against the wall in silence.As soon as I saw the doc he was like, looks like it\'s your back since you are standing and can walk no faster than a turtle. He pressed on my spine a bit and pretty much broke it down to me pretty simple. I would just have to wait it out. He prescribed me some meds that they had stocked on the premises, much appreciated since I didn\'t want to go to a pharmacy after this too. Then came the part of payment. I had no clue how this worked. Like I said, I never in my adult life had to go to a doctor so when they asked me how I wanted to pay I was like ... um I think I have insurance :Unfortunately they don\'t do things like that. But they filled out a form that they gave to me to call my insurance company with. I can understand that. But it was a little weird. So long story short you have to pay upfront and then get reimbursed later by your insurance. Overall great experience. I know it sounds stupid, but because the recommendations were just, wait it out, I was a little disappointed, since I was planning on doing that anyways. The meds that were prescribed did help considerably with the pain thankfully so I guess that is something.We\'ll see if I return, hopefully not and I can go another 1015 years without a doc again.'),(1777,223,5,'Just got back from 5 hours at Care Practice and although I\'m exhausted from the medical ordeal I could not be more happy we went to this facility.

I could tell he was looking at the situation holistically, being sure he really understood my boyfriend\'s habits and lifestyle.

Care Practice is what I wish all doctors\' offices could be.

Dr. B genuinely cares about, and understands, addicts, and goes out of his way to make patients feel comfortable. His understanding of addiction has made my life inexpressibly better and easier since I started coming to Care Practice. I can say without exaggeration that my life is better for having found this place. I recommend it without any reservations. I read a comment on another board that someone thought the induction cost at CP is too high, and that they don\'t like the fact that CP may ask for a deposit for suboxone induction appointments. But Care Practice\'s fee for induction is the lowest I\'ve ever seen also, far lower than the cost of being an active addict!. As for the deposit, from what I understand, doctors get a very high rate of noshows for suboxone induction patients  way higher than the usual noshow rate. Each noshow costs money, so it makes sense for doctors to ask for a deposit for induction appointments.

I\'m already feeling a lot better.He also was able to see me the same day which is really really helpful because I was in so much pain I could hardly walk.I hope I never get sick again but if I do I will look forward to paying Dr Tsang another visit. 5 star, highly recommend. :'),(1803,224,5,'Dr. Tsang has been a wonderful PCP for me.

But that\'s about it, when it comes down to it he\'s kind of an idiot. I went in for a tailbone injury and he ended up prescribing me a pain patch designed for aftershingles treatment. Shingles is a skin rash. Not only did the patch make the area feel more painful, but it cost over $100 out of pocket. And Dr. Ming said there is nothing he can do about it. He apologized which is nice, but nice only gets you so far doc.'),(1805,224,1,'Dr. Ming Tsang is a nice person, and as a doctor he is kind and compassionate. I do however think he is an idiot.I had the flu back in July and normally wouldn\'t care to see a doctor about it, but with all this stuff about swine flu etc  I decided to stop in for a visit. Dr. Tsang checked me over and gave me some medicine. He seemed to lack some basic knowledge for example that Vicodin was the same thing as hydrocodone and that there was a difference between an expectorant for coughs and an antihistamine.While having to explain to a doctor what certain medicines are for is certainly annoying, and perhaps even worrying, that\'s not my gripe. What I am annoyed about is that he sent me to get an Xray at the hospital across the street. My insurance is great, but the hospital he sent me to was not in my medical plan. So now for the Xray, I am being charged $518 from my insurance bill! The xray would have been covered totally free if he sent me to the correct hospital.So this mistake is ridiculous, but the story gets more annoying. I thought it\'d be nice to know if I have swine flu  that was the reason why I went to see him. So after I requested I get tested for swine flu I was told that I\'d need to wait 3 or 4 days to get the results. Well 3 days go by and I\'m told the results aren\'t ready and to call the next day. On the 4th day I call and the nurse later the doctor confirmed this tells me that the lab doesn\'t process samples in the way that he collected my swine flu test anymore. Apparently, the lab changed the way they collect the specimens and forgot to tell Dr. Tsang. Come on now, I\'m not sure if I believe this one. So I was told that if I want to get the test results, I\'d have to come in and redo the test! So I said, yeah  I\'m sick, I\'ve been sick and I\'m getting sicker, let me come in and redo the test. I\'d like to know if I have the swine flu.This phone conversation was early in the morning. The nurse told me she\'d call me back a little later and schedule a time to retake the swine flu test. She never called me back, so I called her at 4:30PM and she said that they don\'t have the kits to test for swine flu, but it\'ll get delivered tomorrow.The next day, I didn\'t get a call from the doctor, so again at 4:30PM I called. The nurse said that they still didn\'t have the tests! Come on, what kind of doctor is this I thought.Finally the next day, Dr. Tsang calls me and apologizes and says that he still doesn\'t have the proper kit to test for swine flu. But good news, the lab was able to somehow mysteriously process my sample Dr Tsang couldn\'t figure out how this was possible and I don\'t have swine flu. I wonder if he just made the results up, but I don\'t care to be honest. That was July, now its August and my illness is gone. What I do have is a bill for $518 from the hospital. 37 minutes ago I was put on hold by the automatic machine that picks up Dr. Tsang\'s messages. I\'m still on hold. Its not even the type of hold that plays music, its just dead silence. This is the 4th time I\'ve called today.... It\'s my birthday, and I don\'t want to deal with this....I\'d like to know what he\'s going to do about my Xray bill, because while I do have enough money to pay for it  I\'m furious that because he didn\'t know what he\'s doing I\'m stuck with a bill for over a half a thousand dollars.So my critique on Dr. Tsang is that he seems like a nice, friendly person  but he stinks as a doctor! I\'m going to change doctors after I get this bill straightened out, because what would happen if I get seriously sick. I\'d probably not do very well under his care....'),(1806,224,5,'Dr. Tsang is a great doctor. He is very friendly and I have never had a complaint about him.

I immediately stop taking the medicine as I had been poisoning myself.I decide to go to a dermatologist about my rash.

On the second day at the clinic I was diagnosed with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, a rare, but debilitating disease. While Dr. Usman, or any other internist for that matter, couldn\'t diagnose me, she gave me hope and made me feel that I deserved an answer. Since my diagnosis, she has taken care of me every step of the way, whether it be finding me a specialist or taking care of my meds or just giving me emotional support.

A month later, nothing had been done until pressure was put on by the office of the GI doctor. Two days before my surgery, I came down with very uncomfortable symptoms of a urinary tract infection & called Dr. Usman\'s office; since this was a day that she was out of the office, I was told that she would be informed and would get back in touch with me. Hours later, I called again to find that she had not been reached; I stressed, again, that my symptoms were getting much worse and that I was concerned about getting a bad infection before surgery. I said that I needed to know if Dr. Usman was available or whether I should try to find another doctor. Her office called back to say that there was a prescription for me and that I \'was welcome to find another doctor.\' This was clearly not a friendly message.

She is always thorough and patient. I love that when she\'s seeing you as a patient she shows absolutely no signs of being elsewhere.

I even once asked her to make a note because I\'d like to bring something up with her during a future appointment, and she said now was as good a time as ever, and encouraged me to just tell her about anything that was on my mind.

It hurts and I wanted it removed. It was on my bucket list and I knew I\'d feel better having it removed.

It was just a nice review of medical history.This was my 5th time getting the shots and it was by far the least painful.

It\'s amazing that a master plastic surgeon is so focused on inner beauty. I\'d say, I\'m thinking about getting *this* or *that* done... and he\'d reply with Why? You don\'t need it.

Dr. Chen took a careful and strategic approach to helping me and I felt cared for the entire way. I had my surgery a month ago my first and I couldn\'t have imagined a better way to have it done. Here I am today doing really well and on track to make a full recovery. I even have one more appointment scheduled with Dr. Chen to make sure everything in back in complete working order.

Throughout the process he was kind, patient with my millions of questions and concerns, and thorough in explaining my options.

His office has an online system that makes sure you check in, sometimes as much as every day, as you recover to make sure that you\'re okay. Like everyone else, I always realize I have more questions after a doctor\'s appointment and I could easily shoot a message to Dr. Chen\'s office and get a response directly from him within 24 hours, often within 12 hours.

After the difficulty sharing the xrays from the emergency room I was nervous about how it would go, but Dr. Chen not only ensured that my mom had access to my information, but was so patient speaking with her on the phone regularly throughout the process.

In addition, I had broken my right femur in this leg. Under these challenging circumstances, Dr. Chen performed successful surgery on my ankle. Kind Bedside Manner: During the months of treatment and recovery, Dr. Chen was most supportive. He kept me informed of all procedures every step of the way.

So in my caseI\'ve decided to only say something when it\'s extremely extremely kindDr. Chen and staff are my 11th review in 4 years...But this is the first time that I\'ve reviewed something more than once  I am so impressed with my visit with Dr. Chen yesterday that I reviewed him on ZocDoc last night and then felt compelled to share with my fellow yelpers as well. it\'s going to be hard to keep this review less than 78 pages long but please bear with me: It all started this last Saturday at around 5:30pmAnd let\'s not forget how wet, grey, rainy and icky it was on this day. My husband, my little girl and I are walking to catch the bus. I\'m wearing my little girl in a bjorn because she\'s only 15 months and not well versed in the art of walking in the rain. My hubby and I are chatting it up when the next thing you know my daughter and I are flying through the air due to my rain boots slipping on some grates in the sidewalk. While in midair I must have gone into mommy bear protective mode because I threw my body backwards so that my daughter wouldn\'t get hurt which she didn\'t so !!!!!!!! for that miraclebut momma on the other hand didn\'t fare so well. Used my right wrist to break my fall  a wrist that has already seen 2 fractures, countless sprains and 2 surgeries. So needless to say it took me a few seconds of sitting in the pouring rain to grasp what had happened and how I was feeling. I felt banged up and my wrist and head were throbbing but as a yogi, rock climber, runner and all around klutzi\'m no stranger to aches and pains. My husband pleaded for me to go to the ER and I decided to be stubborn and not listen surprise surprise .  I tried to be tough on the bus for the sake of my pride and to put on a brave face for my soaking little munchkin. We went home, I took a bath in epson salt, took an ibuprofen or 6 and thought i\'d be good as new in no time.Fast forward a few hours later and my arm feels like it\'s going to explode from pain and my body is starting to feel like it was hit by a giant GOOGLE bus. End up at golden gate urgent care early sunday morning leave 2 hours later with a swollen bruised neck and body and an xray showing fractures and sprains in my right wrist. I was also given a referral to followup with a sports medicine doctor orthopedic surgery. They suggested Dr. James Chen stating that he was good, easily to schedule with and accomodating. With only one working handquick and easy is exactly what the doctor ordered!!Below you have my review from ZocDoc:  After getting home from urgent care, I went on ZocDoc to schedule my followup. The first available was for Thursday April 3rd. I took it and then messaged Dr. Chen asking him to please call me if he had a cancellation and could schedule me earlier. I emailed him at 9:35pm and he responded 11 minutes later asking if I could come in the following day 33114 at 1:30pm. Impressive right?!! I accepted the appointment and showed up fully expecting to have to wait a while since he and his staff had to squeeze me inBUTI didn\'t have to wait at allI actually think they called me in early. And the most amazing part is that everyone there was so friendly. Not just nice but really really nice. In the time I was there I interacted with 2 receptionists, Dr. Chen\'s assistant, a super sweet lab technician, an exwrestling trainer that sent me off in a sexy black cast;, and Dr. Chen himself. He was easy to talk to, a good listener and extremely thorough and patient for having squeezed me in. Not to mention that he paid attention to each of my concerns even though the neck is not even his area of expertise. When somebody is in pain from head to toe and dealing with numerous bodily injuries on a stormy, cold rainy day, this is the type of place and people you want helping you. Thank you Dr. Chen and staff for your warmth and hospitality.And must addDr. Chen noticed that my neck was swollen and xrayed it. The xray images were funky looking so he suggested an MRI. I agreed that a closer look was necessary so he pulled out his cell and called RadNet Imaging and had them squeeze me in an hour later. I was at Radnet until 6:15 completing the MRI process. At 8:30 that night, I received a call from Dr. Chen with the results of my MRI and treatment optionssuggestions.   Againthis is quality care. Thank you Dr. Chen that Jesuit High School in Sacramento sure produces some successes or so I\'ve been told.'),(1910,228,5,'Never broke anything until now... blah.I was referred to Dr. Chen and thank goodness I went because him and his staff made this experience rather more entertaining than anything else.Location is pleasant, simple, clean and certainly no issues with street parking if appointments are made midday.

They are very personable, friendly and they make coming in for a visit so painless and enjoyable. Right? A doctor\'s visit? Enjoyable?

He took xrays, and found something a little suspicious so suggested an MRI. His office\'s relationship is so good with Rad Net Imaging that I was able to go over and do the MRI right away. Bad news for me was that I had 2 herniated discs and a pinched nerve route. My MRI was done at 6pm and Dr.Chen called me that same night himself, first leaving me a message around 8pm and then left another around 9:15pm. I\'ve never had a doctor go so out of their way to call me twice in an evening unfortunately probably because my results were so bad, but also because he saw that I was in so much pain and it was important that I know. To me, that shows a doctor that cares. Not to mention, he had notified my primary doctor asap also because I received an email from her first thing the next morning. I followed up with Dr.Chen and he did suggest seeing a spinal specialist since that\'s not his specialty, and gave me the name of the doctor he would chose to work on himself if needed.

Great fun but a lot of wear and tear, but when I had a horrific fall last year I tore everything and suffered excruciating pain. The doctor I was seeing, who shares an office with told me I had a perfect elbow and after 4 cortisone shots that did nothing, I asked him to take an MRI. That changed his opinion real fast. To make a long story short he suggested I see Dr so and so because he didn\'t do this surgery anymore. I did my own researching since I had no trust in him.The first day I saw Dr. Chen with my MRI he explained what had happened and I asked when he do it.

The wound care clinic suggested I see Dr. Chen, and I\'m really glad I did. He quickly discovered that, in addition to the break, I had also disconnected some tendons in my ankle mortise. He ordered an MRI later, which confirmed this.

Dr. Chen personally went to the clinic later the same day as my appointment to retrieve the missing xray images. Dr. Chen performed my surgery, installing a plate and screw. Absolutely no problems. Even after my first consultation, Dr. Chen had given me his cell phone numberthis came in handy when, the night of the surgery, I noticed red showing through the cast. Alarmed, I texted him a photo and explanation. Even at 10 PM, he immediately called me back, asking for details, then reassuring me there was nothing to be concerned about. The next day, he called to checkin with me. Needless to say, I was thankful for his concern and dedication. Now, back at school, I\'m on the road to recovery. He called the Health Center here to make sure they were on the same page for expectations of recovery, care, etc. He has emailed me several times to checkin, and has even asked for me to send him photos of my wounds every week until they\'re healed. Even after the appointments and surgery, Dr. Chen is continuing to take great care of me.

I felt a tiny bit annoyed by the splint on my nose, but THAT\'S IT! I followed my post op instructions that Magaly carefully detailed for me  like a champ. I chugged water constantly, slept, kept my head elevated, iced. Friday I went out for a short walk. I HAD ONE TINY BRUISE ON MY LEFT CHEEK. I couldn\'t believe it. Even though Dr. Eshima had already told me that I prob wouldn\'t bruise, I don\'t know, I guess I\'m a New Yorker at heart and thought that had to be b.s. It wasn\'t! Other than the splint making me look a bit silly, I WAS FINE. I kept thinking, when is the pain gonna kick in, and, it just didn\'t. I couldn\'t believe it!! I held off for years because of my fear of pain!  Anyway. Saturday, my friend left and I hung out for one more day just to give my nose a few days before I jumped on a plane back to LA.   I flew back to LA on Sunday morning. Yes, you have a splint on your nose which is not the best look, but I just worked it for sympathy. I suggest you do the same. They bumped me up to first class on my way home without my asking I credit the splint. I went home and resumed my life! You have to take it easy, but life was pretty much business as usual. I was so antsy all week to get my splint off and see my schnoz! Thursday I jumped back on a flight to SF I guess a lot of people just stay in SF, but I had work to do back in LA, and honestly the traveling was easy peasy. Thursday Dr. Eshima took my splint off and I cried. My nose was perfect!! He told me it would be swollen for a while, that my nose will get less swollen and look better and better over the next few months, but honestly? I loved it from the second I saw it. It\'s straight. I can smile and no monkey face. Dr. Eshima....is THE MAN.    The next day 8 days post op I was ON STAGE performing! I still cannot believe how easy my recovery was. I wish I had done this YEARS ago. What other reviewers are saying is no joke I keep getting compliments on my appearance you look so gorgeous these days! but not on my nose. People do not notice anything about my nose, they just think I look better than ever. Which I do, thanks to Dr. Eshima.  I wish I could buy him an island, I\'m so grateful.  I am also sooooo appreciative of Magaly and Cathy who also dealt with my 1000 questions, walked me through each step, and called me EVERY DAY to check on me.  This office is where you want to be. Amazing!!!!!!'),(1929,229,5,'At my 60th birthday party I didn\'t want to be in any of the photographs. In fact, I never wanted to be in photographs. The way I looked on the outside was not how I felt on the inside. Who was that in the mirror smiling back at me? Someone who lost the battle with gravity and the march of time! I stopped procrastinating and made the decision to undergo elective aesthetic facial surgery. The opportunity to look refreshed and less tired, to turn back the clock a bit? The goal of this surgery for me would be to feel great about being in family photographs. I\'d heard about Dr. Eshima from my friends over the years, and after meeting with several surgeons, as soon as I met him I felt at ease.  He listened carefully. I experienced him as thoughtful, humble, and yes, very confident. Confidence is important when someone has a scalpel on your face! Also, not all plastic surgeons have the same training. In fact, plastic surgery and facial plastic surgery are two separate and distinct specialties I researched!. I learned that Dr. Eshima\'s training and education has earned him an international reputation for excellence, and that he\'s focused exclusively on the face and neck. I asked a lot of questions. I always do. I wanted to understand if he was passionate about his work. It\'s important to me to know that the surgeon I chose would be insanely wellprepared, obsessive about details, respected by his peers, and sensitive to me and my goal. After looking through a stack of before and after photographs with him, I understood that what I wanted wasn\'t to look \'different\' but instead, to have a rejuvenated look. Every picture showed a person who looked very much like themselves Before yet seemed younger, less tired, refreshed, and natural After. Those pictures said it all to me. I knew I could do this... I scheduled a date for a Rhytidectomy FaceNecklift surgery, and a Blepharoplasty upper eyelids. The process has been as excellent as the results. What I learned is that Dr. Eshima\'s team is world class. And I don\'t use that term lightly. From start to finish, they are expert at all aspects of education, preparation and postop care. The hospital experience was likewise excellent. At 7:20 a.m. I was rolled into surgery and then I woke up later that evening in the hospital suite. Amazingly, I did not have any significant pain! This was shocking to me. I hate pain medications and I was dreading them. Yet in the first 48 hours after surgery, I took only two pain pills! I had been told that Dr. Eshima\'s surgical expertise was such that his patients did not experience complicated recoveries. I didn\'t know what to expect postop but I\'d seen my friends who sometimes looked as though a Cadillac had hit them in the head  for 68 weeks! Obviously, these were NOT Dr. Eshima\'s patients. For a surgery like mine, I was shocked at how good I felt just a day later! I opted for a private nurse to be with me postop in the hospital and then to come to my home for the next 48 hours. It was the best decision! To have someone who understands exactly what aftercare is required, and who helps you through the first few days of caring for the incisions, etc., this absolutely reduces the stress.  Not everyone has a friend or partner who is confident at helping to care for incisions, every few hours the eye drops, and cold compresses.  Aftercare is so important and Dr. Eshima\'s private surgical nurses are experts. I can\'t imagine going through this without my nurse, Mary Kay! Throughout the process, Dr. Eshima\'s team was in constant contact with me. For the six weeks since the surgery, they are still following up on my care. Again, they are representative of Dr. Eshima\'s standards for patient care and recovery.I\'m now 6 weeks postop. Every member of my family, every friend who\'s seen me, and most importantly, my 87 year old Mother, all think I look the same, only better. That is actually what I hoped for! When I look in the mirror I am happy to see the person I\'ve always been, only better! The march of time and gravity on my face has been postponed!  Dr. Eshima exceeded my expectations. So why did I wait so long?'),(1930,229,5,'A photo taken November 30, 2014, sagging cheeks, lowered brow, sagging neck with skin folding over lower neck. Hit the big 65 in 2014. I refuse to put up with aging that distorted my natural beauty and made me very sad. If your like me you are fantastic and wanted to select the best outcomes I could find for a cosmetic procedure. To restore the balance, the shape of cheeks and return my neck to its rightful place, that sharp, defined, firm neck I had. Having the lifted fresh look to the brow, smooth, with those frown lines changed. I also had a old scar on the left cheek, that puckered, now can be covered easily with concealer, frankly I go bare faced, with sunscreen every day to the gym. Once I found Dr.Issa Eshima, and got the Botox out of my forehead. I booked a surgery date December 2, 2014Dr. Issa Eshima and his skillful office staff. Gave me the V.I.P. Treatment. That\'s the positive and very knowledgable care. To get the results you will enjoy and amaze yourself each day.You must be very motivated to care for yourself, follow the instructions given to you and be ready for a change in your life. I shopped around and was not satisfied with the level of dedication, expertise, of the other surgeons in my area or even not in my area had. Dr. Eshima is my choice and going in to the surgery I was confident he was the very best. There a lot to do, eat well, rest, and follow the directions you are given, did I mentionthe staff call you at home each day, to encourage you and inquire about how you are doing, plus you see Dr Issa Eshima a lot, he\'s making sure everything is going well and you are getting the his attention at this important phase of the recovery process.You have to discuss your routine with Dr. Eshima and commit to the week by week beauty plan. Yes, this is a beauty plan and I could see how this worked out to get the results. ByJanuary 2nd 2015, New Year\'s Eve party I went and all my friends said Wow, you look beautiful. Other comments, that\'s the most natural face lift I have ever seen. What\'s the Drs name, do you have his card? And the best, what is your secret of your beauty? Dr. Issa Eshima is my doctor and he\'s the BEST. My final photos with Dr. Issa Eshima will be later this spring, I do look at the Professional befores Dr. Eshima took at his office. Just to remember how I used to look like, with all the signs of aging. The real reason I post this is do not mess around, with quick fixes, or any procedures that you have not investigated. This is your face and getting the BEST is simple. You deserve it, go for it, it\'s just wonderful. Thank you Dr. Eshima.'),(1931,229,5,'I am a 30 year old female who had a rhinoplasty with Dr. Eshima in January 2015. I couldn\'t be happier and I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Eshima; I only wish I\'d done my procedure earlier! I traveled from Saudi Arabia where I currently work... I am originally from CA for the procedure and Dr. Eshima and his office were absolutely wonderful and flexible in making all arrangements with me from overseas; they were incredibly gracious even when I had to reschedule my surgery date twice due to scheduling conflicts.As soon as I met with Dr. Eshima for the consultation I knew he was the right surgeon for me. He understood exactly what I wanted and showed me photo after photo of the impeccable noses he had done. So many doctors post hideous, fake looking \'after\' noses on their websites but each and every nose Dr. Eshima had done was wellproportioned and elegant. He told me up front that he was not the cheapest option and encouraged me to consult with other surgeons to make sure I was 100% comfortable. However, after meeting with one other doctor I knew it was a waste of time and that Dr. Eshima was the right choice for me.And I was right... the results were even better than expected! Everything went like clockwork and Magaly and Cathy in his office walked me through every step of the way and the entire team worked to make sure I was 100% comfortable throughout. One of the most surprising things for me was that I never felt any pain; the healing process is a bit uncomfortable and tedious but although I only took the narcotic painkiller once the first night and then switched to Tylenol, I was never in any pain at all. For those coming from out of town I highly reccommend the Fairmont for recovery; if you stay in Tower room there is a direct elevator straight from the garage up to the rooms so it is easy to be discreet i.e. you don\'t have to go through the lobby or wait for them to bring your car around.I met with Dr. Eshima one week postprocedure to remove the cast and then a week later to remove the stitches right before my travel back to Saudi Arabia. When I told him I hadn\'t yet sent any photos of the new nose to my fiance he was incredulous and made me promise to keep him updated on my fianc\'s reaction... I was happy to report that my fiance was as happy as I was with the results and repeated over and over how natural I looked and that Dr. Eshima is a genius.The most surprising element of the whole experience though was that, although the procedure totally reshaped my nose bridge, tip, and nostrils, none of my colleagues or friends noticed I\'d had rhinoplasty! As I am a University instructor, they hadn\'t seen me for more than a full month over our winter break and when we started Spring semester all I heard was, you look great, or something about you is different but I can\'t put my finger on it, or where did you go on vacation? you look relaxed... did you get a tan? I attribute this to the fact that the results are incredibly natural looking or, as Dr. Eshima puts it, the nose you should have been born with.I was very nervous to do any kind of procedure since I am terrified of hospitals I pass out even getting blood drawn! not to mention the fact that we were dealing with my face which means there\'s no place to hide if something goes wrong!! However, Dr. Eshima has a rare combination of aesthetic sense, technical skill, and topnotch office team which made the entire process and the results simply flawless.'),(1932,229,5,'Having modeled in my past, I grew up under that strange dichotomy of being horribly selfconscious, yet vain. As I entered my 30s, I found that my favorite feature my eyes was the one most aging me. What were my bedroom eyes in my 20s became my hooded eyes at 30. My eyes appeared to have double eyelids, with an excess of skin resting on my eyelid crease. I tried remedying this with botox to get a brow lift, but the results were minimal at best and compounded the problem at worst. Finally, I came to the conclusion that with the amount of money I was spending on botox and creams each year, I could ultimately save myself the disappointment and cash by getting an upper eye blepharoplasty. Now remember when I said I was vain? Right. I am not just going to let Anyone cut up my face. If the results had been bad, I am not sure mentally I would have dealt well with that. I wanted the best and after an extensive search that took me Years, I placed my faith and face in Dr. Eshima\'s hands. No, it is not cheap, but this is your face. Do you want a Groupon for your face? Let\'s be real.Dr. Eshima\'s staff function efficiently and attentively. There was never a time that before, during or after I had the procedure that I felt afraid of the outcome. When your doctor produces results like the before and after pictures I had viewed of Dr. Eshima\'s clients, you do not fear that you will be botched. This peace of mind is priceless. His work is simply masterful. It is much overused in the world of cosmetic surgery to say someone is an artist. If the general cosmetic surgeon is an artist, then Dr. Eshima is a genius. I am beyond happy with my results and I suggest you visit him for a complimentary consultation. I have referred a few friends who are intending to have procedures done as well and he is the soul of discretion. You owe it to yourself if this is what will make you happy. It means so much to me to look in the mirror now and Love what I see.'),(1933,229,5,'Two years and 8 days ago today, I met Dr. Eshima and his staff. I was 47 years old. I was impressed with Dr. Eshima right off that bat. He asked the right questions and even recommended that I lose 510 pounds and that could take care of my concerns. He showed us me and my husband pictures of his patients, and we were impressed. He also suggested that we look throughout the world for plastic surgeons to fix my neck. We nodded, got the quote and left.As soon as we got in there car, we both agreed that he was my guy. BTW, my husband did not want me to get the surgery but he knew he had no choice...I was going to get my neck done BEFORE I turned 50.Fast forward 15 months and I had a lower face and neck left. I also added in my eyelids just because I was already going under. Here is what happened the first 30 days after my surgery:1. My husband looked at me differently. You will recall that he did not want me to get the procedure done. However I did score 6 carat diamond stud earrings...saying that he missed my 30th birthday the first time around. We met when I was 38 and he said in awe that he has never seen me look so young.2. I got carded...twice...okay once was at Safeway...but the other was at a bar in Sunnyvale, and the bartender was FOR REAL! And he was HOT too.3. I saw my neighbor at the mailbox and she said that my haircut made me look so young. I just laughed and said...no...it\'s not the hair...I had a facelift! Her eyes about came out of her skull.4. My sister came to take care of me after my surgery. She is 8 years older then me. We picked her up at the airport 4 days after my surgery. She said...oh my..you look like you did when you were young.. I replied...I am young!So now...2 days short of 9 months after my surgery...I feel and look great. I look so natural. Really it is unbelievable. No one can believe I am the age I say.Take the plunge...you won\'t be disappointed.'),(1934,229,5,'I heard some of my neighbors talking about Dr. Eshima, so I asked my primary care physician about him. Her simple answer was He is the best. I will say up front that Dr. Eshima\'s services are more expensive than other surgeons. However my response to this was that I did not want to save money on my face. He is known for his beautiful and natural work. He only works on faces so he has truly perfected his skill as an artist. My biggest fear in the years I have been thinking about doing this was that I would end up with a facelift look. That would be horrible. Dr. Eshima\'s facelifts are completely natural. After my first consultation I knew that he was the right choice.I have thin skin and, although I had always looked younger than my years in the past, I had reached a point now in my early 50\'s where the lines and sagging skin around my mouth and eyes was making me look older than I was. I had given up on eye shadow because there wasn\'t any point  you couldn\'t see it!  I had a full upper and lower facelift, neck lift and lip shortening highly recommend the lip lift. The works!! Dr. Eshima and his staff held my hand throughout the following days and weeks and made the whole experience a positive one. I am now at thee months postop and I feel that I look like myself, only much, younger! I am having so much fun playing around with makeup like I was a teenager again!!! I feel amazing. I get a lot of compliments on how I look but noone has guessed, it looks so natural.Not like a facelift at all. My sister, who never thought about doing anything like this, is seeing Dr. Eshima in June.'),(1935,229,5,'WHY DID YELP REMOVE MY REVIEW? PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE AGAINMost of the other posts have addressed how amazing Dr Eshima\'s work is. I went to a well known Bay Area spa for thermolage to tighten my sagging 59 year old skin. They told me there was no chance it would work, I needed a face lift. Luckily, they told me they got to see lots of doctors work, and the one that did consistently beautiful, NATURAL work, was Dr Eshima. Full disclosure, he is going to be more expensive than the rest. However, in this case, you get what you pay for. Save money on everything BUT a facelift. Go to the best, get it done right. Dr Eshima is talented, warm, funny, a genuine nice guy with great patient rapport.I agree with all the other posters on their assessments of his surgical talents, so I thought I would share some of the reactions I have gotten on my renewal....I needed some new makeup at Nordstrom. The makeup artist was matching my foundation, and paused. She said Can you tell me your daily cleansing and moisturizing regimen, your skin is gorgeous I laughed out loud, and did not want to seem rude so I told her the 6 weeks ago I had a lower face lift. She was shocked. She told me she worked for 15 years in Boca Raton. She called it home of the facelift. She said she would not have asked the question if she thought I had a facelift. She said mine was the only face in all her years that she could not tell and the best one she has ever seen.My co workers just look at me, and when they find me alone ask questions. You look so beautiful you look 20 years younger You look so happy I could go on and on...I tell them I lost some weight and had been exercising, some really push and to them I whisper, If you must know I did some botox, shhhhIn some store a few days ago and the salesperson says Miss, can I help you? He was so close I looked around to see who he was talking to. LOL, he was talking to me....I\'ve been a m\'am for the last 20 years....I go to ballroom dance at the junior college Friday nights. It is a mix of students and people in their late 50\'s and 60\'s, even a few in their 70\'s.  I am not used to men talking to me much...I have spent the last 18 years immersed in my children\'s lives and working multiple jobs, doesn\'t leave much free time for socializing. Anyway one man who has been in my class for the last year, was dancing with me, and said Did you cut your hair it was down and I thought a mess so I said yes He said Wow, it is so flattering, you look gorgeous Just said Thanks. Another man said, That dress looks great on you Mind you I have worn that dress before and no compliments.....Went to Salsa Halloween part at Allegro Ballroom in Emeryville which by the way is a great, safe fun place to dance and learn... Danced until I thought my feet would fall off. Partners of all ages, but, the compliments NEVER stopped. I got asked for my number more times than I have in my ENTIRE life. The compliments....my head was just swimming. I just want to pinch myself. So much fun. After the seven year divorce from Hell, life has begun again, and it\'s not good, it\'s great.Finally Dr Eshima\'s staff Magaly and Cathy are the best. I don\'t want to forget to mention that I also had a lip lift, the scar under my nose is so tiny and more teeth showing definitely are a component of looking more youthful. This is a tricky piece of surgery and if you are looking for someone who can do it right, that alone should make you consider Dr Eshima.So much better than Botox and it will last......'),(1936,229,5,'My experience with Dr. Eshima\' s surgical expertise combined with the personal celebration of renewed youth has been life changing for me. I will always be grateful to him as a remarkable man and masterful plastic surgeon. What prompted me to seek plastic surgery? My sagging neck, droopy eyes and deep smile lines were showing my ageing 61 years. So, 13 years ago when my girlfriend had facial plastic surgery I was moved by seeing her look years younger and motivated to have some work done myself. Albeit, I could see my friends facial surgical scars at her hairline and around her ears and her face looked a bit tight. So, I began surveying the California market for the best of the best plastic surgeons for my own procedure. I spoke with my upscale hair dresser, my dentist and several physicians who were personal friends. I came up with three recommended names here in the city; I made appointments with all three surgeons to discuss a possibility of surgery. My visit to Dr. Eshima was the last appointment of the three resulting in a clearcut path forward; he was my first and only choice. Dr. Eshima spent nearly an hour with me discussing the procedure, sharing before and after photos of his patients and the probable results. We laughed about my sagging neck; he added that with his special surgical procedures my neck would be as permanently suspended much like the Golden Gate Bridge. He was 100% on! I am delighted to say that today, 12 years later my neck is as youthful as it was in my 20s, my smile lines probably look like a 40 something and even my eyes reflect a bright and energetic gaze, looking 100% alive. Since I now still look much younger than my age, with no more grandmotherly dresses and drab colours.  I now dress with classic elegant colors and stylespeople say I am soooo panache. I laugh to myself when I walk down the sidewalk and men much younger than myself glance at me with that look of interest. Ha, ha guys, thank you Dr. Eshima.Dr. Eshima, at my stage in life, I am eternally grateful to you for turning back my timeclock. Since my surgery, I walk with my head held high.

My first surgery was a blepharoplasty about six years ago. It went so well that when the rest of my face started to sag there was only one facial plastic surgeon I would allow to work on me. So, I had a lower face lift, lip shortening and a slight brow lift. I now look better than I ever have in my life at age fifty. And, I look completely natural.Doctor Eshima only does faces so he is unlike many other plastic surgeons who work on other body parts and only occasionally do the face.  He is also a perfectionist which is exactly what you want when someone is working on your face. And, with his amazing staff, I felt well taken care of every step of the way.So, if you are going to have facial plastic surgery, beg, borrow and steal, because Doctor Eshima is NOT cheap, and go to the best.

During my consult Dr. Eshima\'s professionalism and excitement for his practice were immediately apparent. He loves what he does and it was clear he was the doctor for me. Throughout the process Dr. Eshima and Magaly, Practice Manager, were forthright about every aspect of the surgery. Their goal of ensuring the absolute best result and process is apparent. I have four children spanning ages from high school to elementary school and they were my primary concern. Magaly was a huge help guiding me in my preparation and postsurgery response, attitude and expectation setting with the children. The three days after surgery were the most intense but I used scarves and glasses and by the weekend was walking the dogs and playing games with the kids. The end of week two felt like another big milestone as I could drive and seemed like a normal mom again.Now, 5 months after surgery, I feel better than I had imagined. I have never spent lots of time on makeup or hair but in the last 510 years I could not get away with a quick face wash and pony tail. I was spending more and more time getting ready to leave the house for any occasion. Sadly, no matter how much time I spent I was still surprised and disappointed when I caught my reflection in a window or mirror. I looked sad, worried, tired. Now I recognize myself again.

He told me to continue my search if I needed to, and to bring my family in just in case they had any questions. I hardly had to explain what I wanted because he knew what needed to be done. I was certain I wanted him to do my surgery after meeting with him the first time. I had a rhinoplasty six weeks ago today, and I am absolutely THRILLED with my results.

A common theme with all the reviews from Dr.Eshima is how natural peoples results are, and thats what you want from plastic surgery.I am so grateful for Dr.Eshima and his staff!

About 9 months ago, Dr. Eshima turned back the hands of time and greatly enhanced my appearance. He far exceeded my expectations especially with regard to sculpting a significantly improved chin and jaw line. I had previous cosmetic surgery that left me with a number of issues, particularly at the jaw line. So, I was looking for a plastic surgeon that concentrated only on facial work and who had the expertise and experience to deal with my issues. Though Seattle has excellent plastic surgeons, I was looking for a super specialist .I started my search by asking my world renowned dermatologist who he would recommend. He said that Dr. Eshima is the only plastic surgeon that he would let touch his wife\'s face.Researching at various medical sites I learned that Dr. Eshima\'s credentials are first rate: Stanford undergradPhi Beta Kappa; UCSF Medical School; Castle Connolly\'s Top Doctors 2012; Top Doctor Plastic Surgeon US News & World Report 2012 etc. I began making preliminary contact with Dr. Eshima\'s office and his staff was most helpful in providing me with more information concerning his background. I was also pleased to learn that Dr. Eshima only does facial cosmetic surgery.At my consult with Dr. Eshima, I was impressed with his dedication, energy and aesthetics. The many before and after photos he showed me revealed that he avoids the done look in favor of natural looking results. Dr. Eshima\'s results though went beyond rejuvenation to a significant enhancement of appearance. I was not surprised to learn that Dr. Eshima comes from a family accomplished in the arts as he definitely has a keen sense of beauty and balance. Dr. Eshima operates at St. Francis Hospital, a lovely private hospital across from his office. I was wowed by the facility and staff at St. Francis. Not only were the admissions people very helpful, but the nurses in the presurgery unit, Marjorie and Susan, were outstanding. Dr. Eshima has been wonderful about followups and postsurgical questions. During my recovery period in SF, Magaly or Cathy called daily to confirm that I was progressing well. Dr. Eshima\'s staff could not have been more professional and friendly. They were always there to help with whatever came up whether it was a big or a small question. I must add that my recovery proceeded quite uneventfully. I had very little bruising or swelling and was soon out walking the beautiful SF hills.My husband and friends are amazed at my results. Generally, the comment is that I look so much better but not done. It was totally worth going to SF to have Dr. Eshima operate on me and he most successfully dealt with those issues left by my prior surgery. I can well understand why people come from all over the world to see Dr. Eshima. He is a worldclass surgeon.'),(1941,229,5,'I am a 51 year old woman who has never done any cosmetic procedure until now and I am not a movie star or anything close to being famous.Dr. Issa Eshima is one of the best decision I ever made next to marrying my husband.  Dr. Eshima has improved the structure of my nose, transformed my droopy Asian eyes, reduced my chubby cheeks, and removed my saggy neck. After narrowing the procedures I wanted to get done, the search in finding a doctor was the most daunting process. I found lots of plastic surgeons, but they did everything from toes to noses. Through blogs and articles written about the elusive Dr. Eshima, I was able to determine he was no ordinary plastic surgeon.  For one, he doesn\'t have a website or television infomercials about his services. Secondly, people who have written about him say he was fantastic and worth flying all the way from Russia, Dubai, Japan, and other far away countries. As for his reputation, he is known for performing on academy award winning actresses. Keep in mind, most of Dr. Eshima\'s patients are based on referrals, i.e. recommendations from other patients. He has no need or desire to advertise so I was calling to make an consultation appointment without a referral from another patient.Most plastic surgeons require a consultation fee, but Dr. Eshima does not charge the normal $150 fee because he does not need to live off of these fees.I decided to combine five small procedures together to reduce the anesthesia and hospital cost: liposuction my neck fat, buccal fat removal  egg yolk volume of fat in each check , rhinoplasty reduce the wide nostril opening, inject Radiesse to create a bridge on the nose, and finally eye lift to remove the heavy lids sitting on my eyelashes. Magaly, Dr. Eshima\'s assistant, went through the preparations for my operation at St. Francis Hospital which is across from the office. A long check list of what to do and NOT do before and after the surgery was what created the best results in recovery besides the doctor\'s skill in the operating room. During the entire one week after the surgery, the two assistants Cathy and Magaly, would call to check up on my recovery. There were always questions big or small during this time period, so I was never alone. I loved to hear Magaly\'s voice assuring me that everything was going well. Dr. Issa Eshima did not make me look like a 25 year old. He made me look beautiful without looking artificial. My new eyes now have a natural crease, a result of his skill in creating a new recessed eyelid from my old saggy Asian eyes . My new nose has a natural bridge which was nonexistent until Dr. Eshima injected Radiesse. To reduce my wide nasal passages, he narrowed them down. As a result, my new nose is proportioned to my face.  Next to my new nose, my buccal fat in my chubby cheeks common among asian people was liposuctioned out from the inside of my mouth BUCCAL FAT REMOVAL through two very small incisions near my back molars which I absolutely could not feel! Wow! Finally, my excess neck fat was liposuctioned out through one tiny 14 hole under each ear lobe and one hole under the chin. All incisions healed very well in 11 days to the point where my friends all asked Where are the stitches and scars? The best compliment came from one friend that said you look fresh, not stretched.I recommend interviewing other doctors before coming to Dr. Eshima to appreciate how good he is. He is not just a surgeon, he is an artist!Update: It has been three months now and the little swelling that I had, has gone down plus my face has softly transformed in the features of my eyes, cheeks, neck, and nose. My face looks elegantly and gracefully done, not jarring like some who get cosmetic procedures with that artificial appearance. There is nothing I regret except for the fact that I should have done this years ago. This is the most intimidating event in my life, but the most beautiful moment I have ever experienced next to the birth of my son. Dr. Issa Eshima should get 10 stars!'),(1942,229,5,'I am a sixtytwo year old woman who as recently as four years ago never thought would have a facelift. People have always said I looked ten years younger than I actually was. Then, over the past three years I started to develop the telltale signs of aging: jowls and a crinkly skinned neck. Though my skin laxity was mild compared to others my age and my husband continued to think I was beautiful it really bothered me. When I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, I saw a dour looking woman even though I felt happy on the inside. I had become very selfconscious wearing turtleneck sweaters which seemed to accentuate the loose skin around my lower face and neck. I began to think I just might have plastic surgery to correct what I didn\'t like seeing. So began my thoughtful approach to finding a plastic surgeon I could entrust my face to. For me, the doctor I would choose would have to be a seasoned surgeon with impeccable credentials, a highly ethical practitioner whose surgical results I found beautiful on someone I knew and in the before and after photographs of other patients. Moreover, the reviews of past patients would have to be excellent. My search led me to the office of Dr. Issa Eshima.It has now been four months since my surgery. I feel fortunate to have had Dr. Eshima as my plastic surgeon. He blends the highest level of surgical skill with an artistic eye to restore beauty and balance to a face and neck that had sagged with advancing age. Dr. Eshima, I feel, is conservative in his approach. He listened attentively to my concerns and he discussed viable surgical and nonsurgical options. He did bring my attention to a feature that was out of esthetic balance and which I was unaware of. When I came to Dr. Eshima I was fixated on my sagging jowls and neck. I thought my eyes looked a little dull, but I never considered that plastic surgery could brighten their look. Thankfully, Dr. Eshima brought to my attention that one eyebrow was lower than the other and that by raising that one to match the height of the other and removing the excess skin on my eyelids he could achieve a more open and brighter look for my eyes. Due to my inherent trust of Dr. Eshima I agreed to have these procedures done and I couldn\'t be happier with the results. On the other hand, I thought my skin could benefit from a chemical peel and Dr. Eshima didn\'t concur. He doesn\'t do procedures which won\'t in his estimation enhance one\'s beauty. I respect him for his honesty and high ethical standards.  Dr. Eshima is tops in enhancing one\'s beauty while achieving very natural results. I look like myself but with brighter looking eyes and a jaw line and neck that look twenty years younger.What I have found interesting are the responses of friends and acquaintances. One month after my surgery people I ran into were commenting on how beautiful my skin looked. Two months after my surgery a friend who I hadn\'t seen in months and who didn\'t know that I had a facelift looked at me and said,  you look great. She is an artist and actress with a keen eye for beauty. The most poignant response was by a very close friend whose eyes teared and said you look so beautiful, like you did twenty years ago.  I think the most humorous response is by another friend who is an artist and photographer who thinks the change he sees in me is from a change in makeup. He said I look so much more beautiful with softer colors. The response that has surprised me the most is that people outside of my close circle of friends seem more open and friendly. I can only attribute this to the renewed kinder expression on my face which really matches who I am on the inside. I could go on and on about Dr. Eshima\'s lovely office and caring office staff, his loving and skilled postsurgical nurses, and excellent anesthesiologist who I felt was topnotch, but I\'ll let those of you who find your way to Dr. Eshima\'s office discover this on your own. I just want to thank Dr. Eshima for a more beautiful me. I have only tears of gratitude for you.'),(1943,229,5,'Getting any facial plastic surgery is scary. You only have one! That\'s why I did research my and chose Dr. Issa Eshima. He has an excellent reputation which extends to many different to many different countries. He is THAT good. When you meet him you will feel his quiet confidence. He shared with me his family backgrounds which ranged from artists to musicians and architects. Talent and attention to detail are in his genes.Magaly and Cathy his staff, almost  literally held my hand thru the entire process. They helped me with all of my concerns ; what other people will think, how to camouflage any bruising, what to eat before and after surgery and where to stay. Mary Kay their nurse was the complete icing on the cake for me. She stayed with me overnight and made me as comfortable as possible. She will make you feel like you are her top priority. She will also make you laugh which was invaluable to me. My face looks 10 years younger and the best part is I look completely natural. I couldn\'t be happier with both Dr Eshimas work as well as the entire experience. Dr Eshima is just what I was looking for in a plastic surgeon.'),(1944,229,5,'It has been 1 year since I had a facelift and upper eye lift and I feel like it was yesterday  the results have not diminished at all. Yes I want to age gracefully, but at some point I realized I was looking unhappy whenever I was relaxed. Due to heavy eyelids and jowls hereditary I felt like people were looking at me with pity or fear when in fact I was feeling quite happy. It is difficult when the world projects sadness back at you due to your appearance when that is NOT how you feel. So that combined with the fact that I will be working for another 20 years due to a late start, I decided to make the investment in myself and began exploring doctors. I had heard there was a doctor who did not have a website or advertisement in the City who was the best of the best. Eshima\'s name is whispered among all the best hairdressers and makeup counters in the city. I was given his name by a woman at a skin spa. I had also been doing significant research online and looking at plenty of before and after photos. Note that very few are brave enough to show beforeafter 12 months later, some results do not last. In addition, you can see the worst of the worst online  the damage that bad procedures can cause is enough to scare anyone. Still I knew there was someone out there that was safe with exceptional results  gravity does not play favorites and clearly some of the more famous women today who assert that they have had no work done and yet look better at 50 then they did when they were 30 have simply found a way to have work without any evidence of such. I met Dr. Eshima and his staff in September 2013 and frankly after viewing his before and after photos I knew beyond a doubt that this was the man for me. He clearly knows his craft and executes it exceptionally well. He only does faces and his results are so incredible that I could not even look at others after I had met him. I had the surgery and came home with tubes in my head  a bit challenging since I live alone but I do not have the luxury of a live in nurse and I simply rested and took care to sleep with head elevated and on my back  a friend delivered milk shakes daily. At 10 days he took out the tubes and the relief of having the tubes out was tempered with the increased swelling  yes, I hated the tubes but honestly, after having them removed I understood their value. Some doctors most will remove the tubes earlier 23 days but the tubes made a significant difference in my swelling and I was glad that I had them for 10 days. As the stitches came out it was amazing to see how quickly the results appeared. I was not yellow, bruised or otherwise. The only marks I had were hidden in my hairline and my eye crease. At about two weeks I felt very good even though stitches were still in place. I returned to work week three and even traveled  which did result in some increased swelling. In general the recovery was very good. As for the doctor and his staff they were great  very patient, kind and considerate. I had to call him the night before my surgery because I had fallen into a car door and cut my eye  needing a trip to the ER. He took my call and calmly told me that everything would be okay and that he would take care of the cut the following morning  giving me instructions for the ER to simply butterfly the cut in the meantime. They call daily after the procedure for 2 weeks and then weekly for another month. They listened to all my concerns and would invite me in to the office if I was worried about anything. Any scarring that appeared was solved with injections and today it is not evident that I had any work done. I wear my hair in a ponytail, off my face, tucked behind my ears, etc. and no one has ever noticed. My neck looks amazing  no turkey waddle one year later.My results are natural  I still look like me. Nothing is tight or overpulled, I still have my crookedness that I was quite fond of, he did not alter my appearance in anyway other than to remove the loose skin around my facejaw and upper eyes. People now look at me and react with a smile rather than a look of avoidance of the grumpy old lady.... : And really the value of that alone is priceless. Thank you Dr. Eshima, Magaly and Kathy. You are a super team and I am so thankful that I found you when I did.'),(1945,229,5,'I\'m not one to write reviews, but having personally benefited from reading the reviews of others for years, I\'ve decided to share some of the details of my extraordinary experience with Dr Issa Eshima.I\'m very healthy, active, and in my early 50\'s. For the past few years, I had been struggling to accept the aging process especially concerning my face which was sagging at a rapid rate. Droopy eyes and jowls, plus the start of a turkey neck. I wanted to regain some vitality and feel attractive again, but only if the results looked completely natural. I would rather have kept my aging appearance, than look like I\'ve had any plastic surgery! When my stylist, who\'s known me for 10 years, said Trust me, you need to go see Dr Eshima, I decided to take the plunge and make an appointment.At my complimentary consultation, I met with Dr Eshima and in short order knew I had found the doctor for me. Not only is he an expert in his field he performs facial surgery, nothing else, and has over 20 years of experience but also he has a most impressive set of credentials. Dr. Eshima was Chief and Director of Plastic Surgery at UCSFStanfordMount Zion Medical Center. Stanford Phi Beta Kappa, and a graduate of the University of California at San Francisco Medical School, he trained in New York under Dr. Thomas Rees, the renowned Manhattan plastic surgeon.His aesthetic is to create a natural, vibrant version of yourself a less is more approach that I embraced. I also looked at a stack of beforeandafter photos and was completely wowed. Every single woman or man looked fantastic!My surgery was done at St Francis Memorial Hospital, and the staff was terrific admitting staff, the nurses, and my anesthesiologist all very friendly and professional. I opted to stay overnight in the hospital the first evening after my surgery, and my private nurse, Kim, was warm and attentive all evening. Afterwards, when I was recovering at home, either Dr Eshima\'s office manager, Magaly, or staff member Cathy, called me every day for 2 weeks to check on my recovery. Magaly and Cathy both contributed to my positive experience, fromthe moment I met them during my first consultation, and throughout my quick recovery.Needless to say, I\'m thrilled with the results of my surgery. My husband is equally happy, and frequently tells me I look just like I did when I was in my early 30\'s. I think I look like myself, just better.Dr Eshima greatly exceeded my expectations he\'s truly an artist and I will be forever grateful to him!'),(1946,229,5,'I\'m writing this review for my other who had a lot of facial plastic surgery work performed by Dr. Eshima this past summer of 2014. Mom wasn\'t able to successfully post her review, so she begged me to help out so she could brag about her newly refreshed, gorgeous face. Her case was not an easy one since she, admittedly, has had some not so great plastic surgery in the past performed by other doctors not in California. However, she is still a nicelooking lady who bore a striking resemblance to Sophia Loren, especially when she was much younger. Still, Mom knew she needed to improve upon her looks and spent a lot of time looking for a facial plastic surgeon who could help rejuvenate her appearance and NOT make any mistakes most important considering her past experiences!!! She talked with several plastic surgeons and knew she had met the right one after speaking with Dr. Eshima and I agreed having been present at the consultation. Dr. Eshima spent a lot of time speaking with Mom and showed her multiple before and after photos of past patients that had phenomenal results. Fast forward a few months and Mom had her surgery with Dr. Eshima and he gave her a lower facelift, eyelift lower and upper, chin modification, upper liplift, and so forth. Mom was pretty bruised and swollen after the surgery but was well taken care of at the hospital by her own private nurse who spent the first night by her bedside. After only a few weeks of healing, it became very apparent that Mom was going to look fantastic and the results became better and better overtime. Now Mom is 6 months+ postop and looking and feeling fantastic. She is thrilled with the results and says someone asked her the other day if her friend, who was also 70 years old, was her mother!!! Yikes, I hope I don\'t get asked one day if Mom is my sister!!! Then I know it will be my turn to visit Dr. Eshima and get myself freshened up. My Mother and I would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Eshima to anyone who is considering facial plastic surgery and that is especially true if that person has a difficult case. On a personal note, I would like to thank Dr. Eshima and his topnotch staff for taking such good care of my Mom and helping to restore her lovely face once again. Eat your heart out Sophia Loren!!!'),(1947,229,5,'I\'m the luckiest girl in the world! That\'s how I feel whenever I look in the mirror. I feel lucky because I had the courage to have a major cosmetic procedure done and even luckier that I chose Dr. Eshima to do it. I am in my late 50\'s and was feeling that the image staring back from the mirror was not the same person that was looking into the mirror. The person that I saw in the mirror was old and tired looking. Because I\'m very active and young in my mind, I was always shocked and miserable when I looked at my face and neck in the mirror.  I told Dr. Eshima that I wanted to look natural  just not tired and drawn. He listened to me and gave me the most natural result imaginable. No one suspects that I had work done. Sometimes people look at me in amazement and say you just look great! but they have no idea that I had anything done.Dr. Eshima was patient and highly skilled from beginning to end. Magaly and Kathy were responsive & professional  I couldn\'t have asked for more in terms of care and communication. I highly recommend this practice to anyone considering facial cosmetic surgery. I am so grateful for Dr. Eshima  I am proof that he really is the very best plastic surgeon in the field.'),(1948,229,5,'I feel very fortunate to know Dr. Eshima. He has done procedures for me, my sister, and my mother. I have also referred several friends to him, who were most thankful that I did. I first got to know him when he was Chief of Plastic Surgery at UCSF when my father was there as Chief of Cardiology. In other words, he was trained and brought up with the most academically revered doctors and surgeons of the day. His patients come from far and wide  Geneva, Abu Dhabi, South Africa, and of course all over the United States. He only does the face. He is very conservative, so any plastic surgery addicts will be disappointed, he will not do something just because somebody wants it  he will only do it if it enhances the individual, but is very strict and will never even approach, much less cross, that invisible line, where someone looks obviously done.'),(1949,229,5,'Story from May, 2013 continues!My 4thmonthpostsurgerymark: Words alone are not sufficiant enough to describe how very thrilled I am with the results of my skin treatment  a chemical peel  I continue to be amazed by how smooth, soft and fresh my complexion has become and is still becoming! I\'m now using Tretinoin Cream, 0.05% about 5 days a week and it keeps my skin glowing!. I am not quite sure if I had any expectations regarding my chin and neck lift; I was not nervous in the least about the procedure due to Dr. Eshima\'s thorough explanation of each step of the procedures. What I knew instinctively from looking over Dr. Eshima\'s former patients\' before and after photos was that this was the only Doctor who could craft a profile for me which exactly resembles my high school graduation photo! I, too, had beforesurgery and after photos taken, at which I still gaze and marvel. These photos  and comments from strangers even, on a weekly basis!  is my proof at how skillful and precise Dr. Eshima\'s surgical hand is. Please know how enjoyable this lifechanging process was, due entirely to Dr. Eshima\'s office staff  Magaly and Cathy  and surgical team, including the caring and professional nurses at the hospital. As I was also in the process of selling my house and moving during the time of my postop care thanks to my incredibly loving mother and father!, I must tell you that even during all of the chaos and emotional stress, there was minimal pain and optimal changes occurring to my face on a daily basis. I spoke to Magaly on the telephone daily, to provide updates regarding my daily routine sleeping upright with the support of pillows, drinking lots of water, eating a very low to no salt diet, standing and walking around the house regularly, and cleansing 3 times per day I noticed that the small amount of swelling and peeling was dissipating at a rate so rapid, that at my 2week postop appointment with Dr. Eshima, he had 3 new patients who were at the office for their anxiousbutexcited first consultation come and stare at me in his postop room, to show me off!Now, I cannot even remember who that middleagedlooking woman was; the one who stared back at me in the mirror. Chronologically, who cares??!! Physically, I have the huge eyes, sculpted chin and tight neck of that of a Gen Y\'er. Forget calling me \'ma\'am any longer, and my work colleagues saying, Gee, you look tired today, ... checkout clerks at the grocery store now address me as MISS!You must choose Dr. Eshima. Oscarwinning actresses have, plus models, moms, grandmoms and more. Best decision I\'ve ever made and money so well spent that I can guarantee you\'ll be devastated if you hesitate another moment to do this ... and miss out on his perfected, precise, topofhisgame craft.'),(1950,229,5,'I was always one of those women who swore they\'d never get plastic surgery. I just wanted to age naturally and gracefully, that is, until reality set in. Gravity and too much sun took it\'s toll on my face, I began to look tired when I was wellrested, and started not to recognize the face in the mirror looking back at me. No amounts of expensive skincare regimes, facial treatments and additional makeup really worked to repair the inevitable effects of the aging process. I wasn\'t sure exactly what I needed to have done, but only that I definitely was there. I wasn\'t expecting miracles but only help to open my eyes more, brighten and lift my face and jawline and reduce the signs of aging.I sought out and consulted with a couple of very reputable plastic surgeons in my hometown of Salt Lake City as well as San Francisco but a great portion of their work was done on breasts. I also wanted someone who specialized only on the face. After talking with friends in the Bay area about my decision to have the surgery, I learned of Dr. Eshima. He had actually performed facial cosmetic surgery on some of them over a decade ago and they still looked PHENOMENAL. They were all in consensus that the ONLY person they\'d let touch their face was Dr. Eshima. After hearing these glowing compliments and researching Dr. Eshima\'s outstanding credentials and positive reviews on the Internet, I decided to schedule a consultation. I had no problem getting an appointment and flew out to San Francisco to meet with Dr. Eshima and his lovely office staff Magaly and Cathy.Let me just sum up our meeting for the purposes of this review and say that Dr. Eshima was absolutely the person who was going to do my surgery. I could not have been more impressed by, not only his indisputably impressive credentials, but also his knowledge and expertise, his very personable and kind manner and his indepth experience and willingness to share that. He was able to make an assessment of what he thought I needed quite quickly and explained each and every procedure in enough detail for me to feel comfortable and at ease with him being my surgeon. Since I was going to be traveling from out of town, we discussed all aspects involved with that, as well. He was never overly eager to push for anything but rather had a quiet confidence about him without being arrogant or pompous. He shared numerous pictures of previous work he had done, quite impressive in and of itself, and made me excited to think that he could do some of the same for my face. The women looked 20 years younger and I was only hoping for half that, at best. I decided to schedule the surgery for 6 months later. My surgery would include a Lower FaceNecklift and Upper Blepharoplasty with Bilateral Ptosis Repair to correct my droopy eyelids.I flew out to San Francisco the day before my scheduled surgery for my preop appointment and had the surgery across the street at St. Francis Hospital the next day. All went exactly as planned. Upon discharge the plan was for me to stay with a friend in the Bay area for the next 9 days to recover before flying home. Magaly andor Cathy called me every day to monitor my progress and provided advice and suggestions for every concern or question I had. The most amazing part however, was how little discomfort I actually had. My bruising was minimal, as well, with some minimal discoloration around my eyes and neck. I returned to Dr. Eshima\'s office a week later for removal of the drains and some of the stitches. He felt my progress was good and I was on a plane back home just 9 days after surgery.The BEST part was when I got home. Even with some redness, minor bruising and slight swelling around my eyes and neck, my husband thought I looked AMAZING! he was the only one who knew. He could not stop looking at my face. I wore glasses for a few weeks and not one of my other family members or friends saw past them to ask any questions. After a week or two, the upper eye redness was easily camouflaged with makeup and that is when the compliments really began. Friends began to comment as the results just got better daily. My eyes were now bright and open, I had cheekbones for what I thought was the first time and my appearance was remarkably more youthful without that tired droopy look. I needed no makeup which I hadn\'t been able to pull off in years. 6 months later the results keep on getting better. Scarring is very minimal and I have absolutely no eye problems whatsoever. I have has regular followups with Dr. Eshima once inperson and the rest via Skype which has worked out very well being from out of town. Needless to say, I couldn\'t be happier with my decision and am absolutely thrilled with the results. Dr. Eshima and his staff have exceeded my expectations and I am more than happy to share my experience with anyone considering a similar journey. Look no further because Dr. Eshima is your man.

He showed me several before and after photos of his actual rhinoplasty patients and I was very impressed with the results. Prior to my surgery, everything was explained to me in a very patientfriendly and clear manner. Dr. Eshima\'s office space is very clean and welcoming, and his staff are true professionals. While surgery is not to be taken lightly, mine went smoothly and my recovery period was exactly what I had been prepared by Dr. Eshima to expect. I experienced very little bruising, and Dr. Eshima\'s office called me every day to check on my progress. My bandages came off after a week and while it takes several months to see the full results, my initial result was stunning.

There was one however whichcaught my eye having to do with a woman wishing to schedule her surgerybefore a consultation. I cannot imagine doing so, as the patient shouldmost definitely meet with the surgeon to learn all about the procedures,and in truth by meeting with multiple surgeons I knew exactly what I waslooking for the moment I met Dr. Eshima.I began researching Plastic Surgeons five years ago at 51 years of age, andhad not met a surgeon who I believed would bring back the \'me\' from twodecades ago. I was introduced to Dr. Eshima through Dr. Richard Glogau, whowas the Dermatologist I was referred to through my mothers dermatologist inNYC. When I explained to Dr. Glogau what my issues were, he recommendedthat I meet with three local San Francisco surgeons, all of whom he highlyrecommended. I chose to meet with two of the surgeons having met withthree surgeons in my own community of Tucson, AZ, and Dr. Eshima was thelast surgeon I met with.

He is kind,detailed, direct, confident, and everything that I wanted in the surgeon whowas going to have my face in his hands literally.I am writing this three months post surgery. I cannot help but look intothe mirror as often as I can, as I not only see a younger me, but the neckand chin that Dr. Eshima constructed for me, are more beautiful than I hadwhen I was twenty years younger or that I was born with.

I had such a wonderful time when I stayed there for about 1 week immediately after my surgery. Magaly and Cathy took such good care of me; I still cannot forget how kind they were! In case anyone is thinking about travelling from abroad to San Francisco to do this surgery with the AMAZING DR.ESHIMA, I\'d like to give you a personal overview of the healing process. I met some new people about 2 weeks after the surgery, and no one actually noticed that I had any eye surgery, which I thought was pretty amazing. I did have makeup on, but I was impressed to know that the swelling was almost gone by this time. The small scars on my eyelids were probably visible but only upclose and without makeup for the first 23 months, and then they began to heal very quickly after this period. If you put on eye makeup during this time, no one will notice! There was absolutely no pain throughout the entire healing process. ZERO PAIN!! In conclusion, my eyes look absolutely WONDERFUL today!! The fold looks very natural, and no one would be able to tell that I had been through some form of eye surgery. In fact, none of my close friends had recognised the change in my eyes until I told them! I also get complimented many times when I go out, which is a treat because I have never been complimented about my eyes before! One friend said to me, you have gorgeous eyes! I had to tell her all about Dr.Eshima!! So psychologically, the surgery has given me more confidence about myself. It has also been so much easier to put on makeup  the fact that I can put on eyeliner without the worry of having it smeared or covered by my upper eyelids is a wonderful feeling! Now it\'s more exciting to put on makeup!I cannot thank Dr. Eshima, Magaly, and Cathy enough. They have all been extremely responsive even after the surgery, and I have been updating them monthly about my eyes!! They are always very happy to hear from me.I am truly thrilled with the result and think that this is one of the best investments I\'ve ever made in my life. 55 STARS!!

I\'ve seen about 9 different plastic surgeons to get a free consult to seek the right Dr to give me the eyes that I have always wanted. Every consult visit I have gone to; each Dr showed me before and after pictures of their previous patients. Out of all the 9 Drs visits there was at least one photo where I did not like how one of the patients\' eyes turned out after their eyelid procedures. I checked the internet for other Drs that were supposedly the best within the US or the world. Again, 4 out of 5 pictures patients after photos were ok however there was always that one patient that didn\'t turn out how i would of liked it too. When I saw Dr Eshima\'s before and after pictures of his patients I did not find one photo that i disagreed with. I was shocked...every single picture was natural, clean and so precise with the right touch. I met Dr Eshima last year for my first consultation for the asian eyelid surgery last year. Dr Eshima off the bat was a very professional Dr like any other doctor. He answered all my questions, told me a little bit about himself and at the end of the consult he did not try to convince me or pressure me to go through with anything. He just told me when I am ready to call or come back as many times as I need to. The beginning of this year I made my second appointment with Dr Eshima. What made me choice Dr Eshima was that his behavior of kindness, the vibe of being a humble man a vibe that can not be faked who took pride in his work of art, his bed side manners and his sense of humor. If your smart enough you can become a doctor, but not everyone can become a artistic doctor with precision and accuracy like Dr Eshima. Dr Eshima was very honest, telling me what might look too unnatural and suggested other routes which I took his advice and now I am so grateful that I had this procure done by Dr Eshima and no one else. From the surgery room to recovery time his staff was awesome! They made sure I felt safe and reassured me that everything was going well. They make sure you are clear about before and after care instructions. On top of that you get a phone call EVERYDAY from his assistants to make sure you are ok. They make sure you are well prepared with medical supplies and medications and answer all questions you have. The procedure was literally PAINLESS! I have never had any clinic, hospitals or Dr offices give such good service like Dr Eshima and staff. I have had prior surgery done before and my previous plastic surgeon and his staff did not treat me the way Dr Eshima and staff did. Their services did not even compare!! At the end its been almost 5 months since my eyelid surgery and I can\'t say enough how happy I am with my results. I get so many compliments, I have more confidence and I hand out Dr Eshima\'s phone number constantly because my friends and family ask me who did my eyelid procedure. My look is natural, he fixed my eyes which my skin was drooping and one eye was bigger than the other. Now my eyes are almond shaped, with the right amount of lift and are evenly symmetrical. I am writing this review because of Dr Eshima\'s skills and services I am such a confident person now with a beautiful face. I have had issues with low self stemknowing looks can\'t fix everything but it definitely helped boost my confidence! Dr Eshima is extraordinary and most importantly he knows what he is doing!! THANK YOU DR ESHIMA, MAGALY and CATHY for your kindness and your hard work...I am your walking piece of art!'),(1956,229,5,'I have been to Dr. Eshima two times. I am going back for a 3rd. The first time was for upper blepharoplasty, the other time was for rhinoplasty. Dr. Eshima is a cultured, funny, class act. His medical care was thoughtful and thorough. One time I needed a doctor\'s opinion about a totally unrelated medical issue resulting from an accident. Because I trust him so much, I called Dr. Eshima. Dr. Eshima and his office worked tirelessly to get me the answers I needed, and to refer me to a specialist outside his practice. NOTHING to do with plastic surgery. Just a caring doctor who wanted to help.My eyes? Gorgeous. No one but my closest friends know anything other than I look young for my age. I\'m 46. I should also say that my eyes were \'complicated\'.  Heavy Claudia Schiffer upper lids. I really like that heavy upper lid, Nordic look and he kept that look. Just reduced the skin so they looked fat and youthful. I had been to many surgeons even Ivana Trumps! to discuss my eyes. Some of the other surgeons ideas and suggestions were so scary. You are going to look different! Be prepared! We are going to \'raise your eyebrows! I thought I would never find a surgeon who would get the nice puffy upper eyelid, but Dr. Eshima got it.My nose? Again, perfect. I was born with a good nose, but over time I noticed it started to droop a little bit which is aging and also a little masculine for my taste. He did a very subtle correction and again, not even my family knows that I had anything done. When I look at my driver\'s liscense from 15 years ago, my nose looks the same.I had to write because of the one negative review. This person is correct, Dr. Eshima would never schedule a surgery without making sure the person has the correct expectations, outlook and mental stability necessary for cosmetic surgery, no matter how much money a person would throw at him. For Dr. Eshima, a \'deposit\' would not be worth putting not only a patient, but his extensive staff and surgical staff in a compromising position. Can you imagine the danger it would put an entire surgical staff in to not have seen a patient prior to surgery? I also think it speaks to Dr. Eshima\'s character that he doesn\'t charge for a consultation. He doesn\'t need that revenue stream.Lastly, I am not a rich socialite nor am I famous, I am a happy, healthy hardworking mom, who just wants to look and feel great for as long as possible.:The negative review sounds like it was written by a nut ball. :'),(1957,229,5,'I traveled from Switzerland: Lip ShorteningLiving in Zurich, Switzerland and working in the media industry I knew I had to be operated by the best. I spent many hours researching, speaking with Doctors, colleagues in my field and friends and finally came across a Plastic Surgeon by the name of ... Dr. Issa Eshima. Dr. Eshima is a renowned facial plastic surgeon located in San Francisco, California. He does not advertise and does not have a website, which already says a lot about his reputation. Clearly, in my case it would be much easier to be operated here in Switzerland or in Europe than to travel to the United States. However, I was also fortunate to meet personally with several patients who were operated by Dr. Issa Eshima. The women I met with were all timeless exquisite beauties. I was in awe.!!!! His work was so natural, no one would of ever known they had been operated. Having consulted with several renowned Plastic Surgeon in Europe and the US, I knew that Dr. Eshima was the plastic surgeon for me.During my Skype consultation with Dr. Eshima he suggested a lip shortening procedure would not only rejuvenate my face, but would balance out my facial features and make my eyes appear larger. Dr. Eshima took the time to explain that as we age, the distance between the upper lip and nose becomes longer and looses the youthful contour. After looking at my pictures in my 20\'s, 30\'s 50\'s ...I saw that he was right...the distance between my nose and mouth had elongated. The difference with the lip shortening is subtle and yet the results are huge. At first, I was very frightened of the scar, but after seeing several of his patients and knowing his reputation, I knew I was in good hands and had complete trust. After my surgery, there was no pain and no bruising. I was really surprised and was presentable in 1 week. The lip shortening procedure plays a major role in creating youthful proportions. There is a saying in the plastic surgery circles and it goes something like this, really good cosmetic surgery will make you look better, but, that doesn\'t mean it will truly make you look younger. Looking naturally younger is really hinged on inclusion of small, well placed subtleties. In my opinion, Eshima is masterful, truly an artistic genius. He shared with me that his mother was an artist and his father was an architect. What separates him from other plastic surgeon is his unique ability to balance out a persons facial features and with minor touches, transform a goodlooking person into a human beauty. He has a certain edge in his ability to make a person beautiful. In my case, he suggested a lip shortening. My girl friend who saw me 1 month later said he took 15 years off and my eyes appeared to be much larger. He has an excellent and dedicated team, Magaly and Cathy. Magaly, the Patient Coordinator called on a daily basis, even on Saturdays and Sundays, to check up on my recovery and if I had any questions. This type of service is almost unheard of. If any of you are looking to have aesthetic treatments or procedures take the time and call the office of Dr. Eshima. He made me look beautiful!'),(1958,229,1,'Shady Policies, Shady PR, AWEFUL Experience!BackgroundDr. Eshima does not have a website while other plastic surgeons who are just as renowned have a photo of themselves, curriculum vitae, specialties, beforeafter pictures, etc. readily available onlineEven if you search long & hard, you will find close to nothing that would add value to your plastic surgery decision makingIn the online community, every single review gives Dr. Eshima five stars coincidence or by design?My ExperienceWhile Dr. Eshima does not provide a picture of himself or details of his background with the potential new patients, the potential new patients MUST provide pictures of themselves outoftown patients and their highlysensitive personal information and medical history TO EVEN BE CONSIDERED FOR A CONSULTATIONDr. Eshima\'s office staff Cathy and Magaly were extremely unaccomodating.maybe it\'s because I\'m not rich or famous, but they were not willing to work with my availability at all and gave me the attitude of take it or leave it.they will not make an appointment even if the dates are available without you consulting Dr. Eshima first they were unwilling to pencil me in on an available date that worked best for my worktravel schedule even though I was ready to pay the required deposit and commit to the surgerywhen I requested some beforeafter pictures to get a sense for Dr. Eshima\'s artistic abilities, they simple said, \'we don\'t have any to give you.\' a more professional response would have been, \'we\'re so sorry, but due to the HIPAA laws, we are not allowed to do so.\'they suggested multiple times to consider other surgeons totally discounting the countless hours of my researchI was highly suspicious of Dr. Eshima having all 5star reviews given the volume of surgeries performed in his career, he is bound to have at least one or two negative ones, so I started Googling different phrases with Dr. Eshima\'s name attached to it. I finally came across a negative Yelp review in Google search results the person said something along the lines of how you will not get good care from his office, unless you are rich, famous, etc.. When I clicked on that review, it was nowhere to be found on Yelp as in, it must have been deletedIMO, Dr. Eshima\'s 100% 5star, raving reviews may be as a result of his practice hiring an onlineinternet reputation management company who will search deep & wide and delete all negative reviewsI wouldn\'t be surprised if this very review gets deleted in the near future I\'ll keep everyone postedConclusionMaybe Dr. Eshima is the greatest thing that happened to plastic surgery since bread, but as a commoner, who make enough to be able to afford plastic surgery, I was pretty much neglected by his staff. Perhaps in another life, when I\'m Melinda Gates or Angelina Jolie, they will treat me like I matter to their practice.Why did I even give his office a chance? like everyone else, I fell for his impeccable online reputation when I first called,they led me to believe that his availability aligned with my availability I foolishly sent them my pictures and completed personal info.medical history documents under this assumption upon receiving all of the requested documentation, they gave me exactly ONE option for the consultation appointment, which was only a few weeks prior to the available surgery appointment and they were absolutely INFLEXIBLE and UNWILLING to work with meBottom LineIf I had a choice between choosing a 1010 surgeon, whose office treats me like an unimportant number and an 810 surgeon, whose office treats me like their only patient independent of the monetary value of the surgery, I would choose the latter.I ended up going with another renowned surgeon ranked in U.S. New & World Report as top 10% in the nation and the difference in how I\'m being treated is literally night and day. they made the consultation appointment and even allowed me to speak to the doctor directly WITHOUT demanding pictures of me or divulgence of my personal or medical informationthey promptly responded to all of my questionsemails and exercised utmost patiencethey made every effort to make me feel comfortable and start building trust Unless everyone you encounter at Dr. Eshima\'s office treat you with respect and make you feel like a valuable patient, look elsewhere.IT IS NOT WORTH PAYING DOUBLE THE COST AND BE TREATED LIKE A BOX OF HAIR!'),(1959,229,5,'I agree with Runnersworld, if I could give Dr. Eshima TEN stars I would!I have been going to Dr. Eshima for different procedures for over 20 years. He only does faces, so if you need body work, he can recommend someone but he just does faces only. Frankly, he doesn\'t need to do anything else because when it comes to your face, he is by far, the BEST, kindest and most thorough Doctor I have ever seen for any medical procedure. My Mother, my sister, my best friend and numerous other friends and acquaintances have gone to him for procedures on my recommendations and not only have they been more than satisfied, they still look FABULOUS! Most of them have come from all over the country, that is how good he is.

His patient list runs from regular folk like me to three Academy Award Winning actresses. He can\'t reveal who they are, of course, but if they don\'t look like had surgery and yet still look fabulous, it\'s probably them!His staff, Magaly and Kathy, couldn\'t be nicer or more accommodating! Every day after your procedure they call you to check in to answer any questions or concerns. If you have any question, no matter how small, you can call Dr. Eshima\'s office any time and he will call you back ASAP to answer any concern you may have.I read the review recently posted below from a person who had never even been to Dr. Eshima\'s office, never met him in person and felt I needed to let other Yelpers know, that in my opinion, the review from Special K couldn\'t be further from the truth. I am not famous and not even close to being rich, yet I am treated by Dr. Eshima and his staff every time as if I am just as important as anyone rich or famous and always feel I am getting 100% of his attention.I also appreciate the thoroughness of Dr. Eshima and his staff to make sure when I am doing a procedure, that I am in the best possible health, and to do so that I have a medical check up before hand. I am more than happy to comply and appreciate that he wants the best possible results for me. Aging isn\'t always easy for some of us but Dr Eshima has made it a little easier with his skill. The man is an artist.I can\'t recommend Dr. Eshima enough!'),(1960,229,2,'I differ from most of the reviewers. It is true that Dr. Eshima is very skilledand he is very smooth. And, everyone in the office is congenial and earnest. I had a facelift and eye surgery two years ago. The chin liftbrow lift part was phenomenalI can\'t complain. I applaud. However, two years out my eyes still do not close. He did way more work on my eyes than I thought would happen. You have to be very careful in this department. I have stopped going for checkups because I am tired of having it blamed on me! I was told that I needed to do more exercises. I have been told by other surgeons that there is nothing in that department that I can doexcept wait or have more surgery. I have another very experienced eye surgeon monitoring me. I do not want more surgery but I am a bit tired of taping my eyes shut every night so they don\'t dry out.  I can\'t fault Eshima for being an artistthat he truly is but blaming me for his misjudgment grates on me. What you need to watch for is that he does not do more to your face than the palette can accommodate. That is what happened to me. I may be more generous than is warranted, but I have waited two years to say anything. The bottom line is that he made a mistake and will not admit it. I would have felt a lot better about all of this if he had been able to say that he overestimated what I wanted. I cautioned him before the procedure about my eyesI was very concerned not to have too much work done on them because of my fear of them not closingI said this several times. He said: trust me. People make mistakes, it is true. This is not a mistake that has been pleasant to live with. Be careful, no matter who does your surgery. Be sure to ask about what the palette can accommodate and do not take cushy reassurances for an answer. 5313 ps: I just want to add that I am not the only person to whom this has happened. Dr. Eshima is very skilled, he\'s a lovely person, and his office staff is wonderful, but I just heard that another person he worked on can\'t close her eyes. I also find it interesting that the next day after I posted the above review I got two calls from the office and then a third call a few days after that. Someone monitors reputation very closelyvery closely. Use the information as you will. I also noticed that someone was quick to post another glowing review to compensate for my very honest appraisal. I am happy for all of those for whom all went well.'),(1961,229,5,'A master! There is no one that can do what Dr. Eshima does. Over 10 years later and I look better than ever this is from friends and also my point of view. He knows structure and he is an artist. I was never concerned about the outcome; he and his office staff are so professional and comfortable. I actually look forward to having some work done, but he said I don\'t need anything at the moment! What integrity. I more than highly recommend Dr. Eshima. He is the only surgeon to ever consider for one\'s face. I have always been amazed that one just looks fabulous but not different at all. Kudos!'),(1962,229,5,'I was long overdue for an upper bleph and ptosis medical term for extremely sagging lids repair, per my ophthamologist. About five years overdue. I had interviewed top surgeons in Beverly Hills and San Francisco, including one who does only eyes. Two of the surgeons suggested a forehead lift as well, for optimal results, and I couldn\'t get out of their offices fast enough. I have nothing against the procedure  I personally don\'t want screws in my forehead! I had even scheduled a surgery date with a board certified Harvard physician, but cancelled it. Too fearful of having that \'done\' look, or losing character in my eyes. At the same time, I was weary of being told how tired I looked, or being asked if I were in pain! At sixty, I felt too young to be considered old and exhausted. Fortunately, I overhead a couple of women speaking of Dr. Eshima, who practices only 40 minutes from my home. I made an appointment, and the moment I stepped into his elegant office, I felt comfortable. His assistants are both lovely and natural looking women, unlike the staff of a few other plastic surgeons whose frozen faces made me question why I was even there. I then spent nearly an hour with the charming and erudite Dr. Eshima. And as soon as I saw the before and after photos, I knew I had found my surgeon! I have never seen such artistry. His patients looked refreshed and rejuvenated, beautiful, and amazingly natural looking. Even the most dramatic work looked natural, with not a \'done\' looking face in the stack of photos. Dr. Eshima made it clear that my ptosis was a medical condition, and the cost of surgery would be covered by my HMO if I had it done there. But after seeing those photos, and a five year search, I was happy to spend my own money with Dr. Eshima. He then suggested that I might want to consider a second procedure I had never heard of: a lip lift. All the while we were conversing about our various interests, he was actually studying my face closely. As we grow older, sometimes the area between the nose and upper lift stretches, covering our upper teeth when we speak, and aging us. A lip lift restores the balance and proportion of a face, something I saw immediately when I reexamined the photographs. After thinking it over for a few days, I decided to do the second procedure, and am thrilled I made this decision! Not even my best friends noticed, and can hardly see the tiny scar in my nostrils when I point it out. But what a difference, however subtle, in the quality of youthfulness. And the new lip line is absolutely gorgeous. The lip lift does look a bit strange the first week or so, but trust me, the swelling subsides! The operation and recovery were quick and nearly painless  and three weeks later I was on a plane to the East Coast to take care of my college age daughter post tonsil surgery. One night at dinner, she looked at me carefully not knowing I had had the lip lift and said \'maybe it\'s because I haven\'t seen you in awhile, Mom, but I forgot how pretty you are!\' Dr. Eshima\'s assistants Magaly and Cathy called every day to check in on me, and no question was too silly or unimportant. They treated me with the utmost consideration and sympathy  friendly, warm and professional. Although HIPAA considerations do not allow Dr. Eshima to speak of his patients, friends in LA know him as the \'goto\' man for several very high profile Hollywood beauties. And I never felt as if I were treated any less cordially than one of those film stars  in fact, Dr. Eshima leant me a CD of music that intrigued me, and we\'ve shared other topics of interest since. Since the surgery, I\'ve been getting all manner of compliments, and have felt so happy about the rejuvenated looking me that I began running again, and actually winning first place in my age division of 60 to 65. There was only one problem once  when I had to show ID to prove I was old enough to race that division! Four months after the eye and lip surgery, putting make up on is a joy. I can\'t recommend Dr. Eshima highly enough  from his bedside manner, upbeat personality, and extraordinary surgical skills, you are literally in great hands. And if, like me, you\'ve been hesitating  hesitate no more. As a young man Dr. Eshima wanted to be an artist  and many years later, he is one.'),(1963,229,5,'UpdateWhen I entered the room I saw a beautiful face, said Dr. Honor Fullerton, my respected Stanford trained dermatologist, who, searching memory, identified the beautiful face as that of a middle aged woman she had seen several years earlier. Dr. Issa Eshima, an aesthetic plastic surgeon in San Francisco, had performed a facelift.A Stanford Phi Beta Kappa and graduate of University of California at San Francisco Medical School, Dr. Issa Eshima was Chief and Director of Plastic Surgery, UCSFStanfordMount Zion Medical Center. Dr. Eshima trained in New York under Dr. Thomas Rees the renowned Manhattan plastic surgeon who performed Jackie Kennedy\'s facelift.I love to travel in Europe, Asia, India, to Egypt and Machu Picchu and treasure the companionship and friendships I make among fellow travelers and local people. My love of life, however, was outlasting my falling face, a face accelerating down. I made an appointment to see Dr. Eshima.At the complimentary interview as he answered my questions and showed many before and after, beautiful, soft and natural photos of his aesthetic facelifts, Dr. Eshima was compelling with his depth of competence and his superb skill, in his knowledge. In a hearty baritone Dr. Eshima spoke warmly of patients, of ambassadors coming from distant cities, from around the world. He lifted my spirits when he said, Aren\'t you excited!, after I said I wanted him to do my facelift. Since then Dr. Eshima\'s love of his work and his dedication have touched me often.The morning of my facelift before beginning Dr. Eshima spoke encouragingly, This is your day! We will have you out socializing again. The first thing I noticed two days after the facelift was the beautiful shape and line of the eyes and brow. Dr. Eshima brought bloom to my face, enhanced softly my profile and restored to youthful oval the line of chin. My neck looks like a schoolgirl\'s. Two months after my facelift uplifted youthful contours look lovely and natural where hollows sagged. Some mornings my refreshed face glows although I am young only in love of life and people.Most important Dr. Eshima performs facelifts in a safe hospital environment where you wake up in your own room with Dr. Eshima standing beside you offering reassuring words and with a private duty nurse to care for you. The first night after my facelift I suffered severe dry mouth and struggled to swallow. Mary Kay, the nurse, gave medication. For three days at home, experiencing treatable pain behind the ear, I was happy to have the help of a private duty nurse.Dr. Eshima\'s followup care and staff are superb. For two weeks following my facelift, every day wonderful Magaly, Dr. Eshima\'s caring, knowledgeable office manager, called to find out how I was doing, patiently solved any arising problems. In addition to regular followup visits, when I developed problems from preexisting dry eyes, Dr. Eshima effectively and compassionately, with sensitivity, treated me as often as needed, saying, We don\'t let you go until the problem is solved. Resourceful Alisha always was ready to help, greeted you with bright friendly welcome.Friends have looked at me wonderingly, saying, You look beautiful, elegant. Both men and women have expressed surprise, You look too young to have grandchildren, when I speak with pride of my cherished grandchildren, some in college. I am excited when I think about renewed possibilities for life Dr. Eshima has given me.Two years have passed since Dr. Eshima\'s facelift gave me a new lease on life. During a recent May, 2011, crease reduction procedure, Dr. Eshima impressed me most with the great care he took to avoid making a scar front between the eyes. Dr. Eshima combined extraordinary skill with his hands for the finest details with beautiful aesthetic sense and consummate surgical skills. With an artist\'s eye Dr. Eshima saw on my narrow face to set back slightly the beginning of the eyebrows to give a more wideset Jackie Kennedy appearance to the beautiful eyes he had made in the facelift. I appreciate the spontaneous kindness and care Dr. Eshima expressed that day to do no harm when I was soon going on a trip, noticed also Dr. Eshima moved casually about the room to see the face from all angles. A lovely Mozart piano concerto distracted from the knife and intricate crease reduction procedure, characteristic of Dr. Eshima\'s efforts to do everything possible for the best experience and outcome.On recent trips, at Stanford class events, on visits to my native Scottsdale, men, old friends who have meant most to me have crossed the room to talk, stayed with warmth and lively interest, invited me to dinner. Whenever I go out I am happy for my face, for Dr. Eshima\'s aesthetic contours that bring vibrancy to my life.Words cannot express my gratitude to knowledgeable Magaly for her caring, good hearted interest and responsiveness. Thank you also friendly Cathy.'),(1964,229,5,'Dr. Issa Eshima is exceptionalin a class by himself. Who else would you want to work on your face? Seven months ago, I was reading his reviews, as you are now. I am a successful professional woman in the high tech industry. Though I am fit, energetic and feel young, my face had begun to sag and I looked tired. I was concerned that if I lost my job especially during the Great Recession, I would have trouble finding another job in the dynamic and youthful tech industry where age bias exists. Plus, I felt I was becoming invisible. Outside of work, I enjoy travel and social dancing and wanted to look as good as I feel. I was selfconscious that my jowls interfered with my profilejawline while dancing and that bothered me. I tried 9 months of fillers, Botox, and laser treatmentswith nice results but they didn\'t improve my jowl or the bags under my eyes. I was ready to consider a more permanent solution, when a local estheticianRN referred me to Dr. Eshima. She said, He is the best. His work is beautiful and natural. I did my research and found he had the best credentials and references. Stanford University Phi Beta Kappa, UCSF School of Medicine, Chief & Director of Plastic Surgery, UCSFStanford and on and on.In person, Dr. Eshima is warm, engaging, reassuringly confident, a perfectionistand he clearly LOVES his work. I was impressed with what he said, how he said it, and with the beforeafter photos he showed me of his patients. I decided on the spot during the complimentary consultation to have him do my lower facenecklift, brow lift, upperlower blepharoplasty eyelids, and lip shortening. He is not only an expert surgeon, he is an artist. In fact, the day of my surgery, I teasingly called him Michelangelo! I am thrilled with my results! But before I get into that, a word about the outstanding support Magaly, Dr. Eshima\'s office manager, provides to the pre and postop experience. She was infinitely patient with me, explaining how to prepare for the procedures and what to expect as I recovered. Then, she called me every day after my surgery for weeks, including on Christmas and New Years to check on me and to patiently answer all of my questions and to offer expert advice. In addition to Magaly, Mary Kay, a private RN recommended by Dr. Eshima, cared for me from the time I got out of the recovery room until I was discharged from the hospital. She was constantly attending to me and I was relieved to have her with me those first 20 hours! The anesthesiologist is excellent as well. I had superb care.The results? I no longer feel invisible. Colleagues and strangers are noticeably friendlier towards me. The people who I meet say they cannot believe I am old enough to have a grown child. My eyes, lips, jaw, and neck are amazingly youthful and natural. There are no visible scars. And I do not look done. It\'s as if 1520 years have vanished from my face.Several members of my family are so impressed with Dr. Eshima\'s work on me that they either have had, are scheduled to have, or plan to have surgery done by him!

He will tell you that eyelift surgery is the most common surgery that he does, and that he has done it thousands and thousands of times.

For the previous five years she had done an amazing job at helping me to age gracefully with various skin treatments and lasers. Something looked very different about my friend , she looked ten years younger!  After relentless prying on my part she informed me of her recent face lift. Knowing that she was married to a prominent doctor herself I was eager to find out the identity of the surgeon. To my surprise it was not her employer but a doctor in San Francisco. She quietly pulled out the golden egg the card of Dr. Issa Eshima. I soon discovered that Dr. Eshima is the surgeon that fellow doctors call upon when their wives are in need of aesthetic refreshment. While most surgeons will do everything Dr. Eshima is unique in that he specializes in faces only.He is a skilled surgeon with the fine touch and finesse of a trained artist. One of the most impressive facts about Dr. Eshima is that he was hand picked and trained by Jackie Kennedy\'s world famous plastic surgeon. His credentials and education speak for themselves!  After two months of contemplation I scheduled an appointment with Dr. Eshima for a consultation. Even though my husband continued to profess his attraction for me, the mirror did not lie. The truth was that two kids in college, caring for elderly parents, and a hectic life, had left me looking tired and aged. Numerous laser treatments , peels, and expensive creams, could no longer reverse years of sun worshipping and excessive stress.   Upon meeting Dr. Eshima I was instantly impressed. He is a warm and caring individual with a wonderful demeanor. Unlike most surgeons he is very punctual and patient , he refuses to rush the appointment. The initial consultation was a wonderful experience, not only was it informative but relaxed and friendly as well. Upon my departure he told me to come back again if I had any more questions. He actually makes you feel like a person not just another patient.I never felt pressured in any way or form! Upon leaving I knew that another appointment was not necessary, Dr. Eshima was the doctor for me.  Six weeks after my surgery the results were incredible! Two of my harshest critics my mother and husband could not believe how much younger I appeared. My husband could not take his eyes off of me, something he had not done for years! The recovery was swift with little bruising. I was surprised at how quickly I was able to resume my normal activities. Just as Dr. Eshima had promised the results continues to improve with every passing day! The surgery and post op visits were just as impressive. Dr. Eshima\'s knowledgeable and supportive staff never failed in their followup and attention to details. Magaly is the most professional woman I have ever met. The woman knows her stuff! She makes sure that every little detail is covered.There is a reason that patients fly from all over the world to see Dr. Eshima. Yes he is expensive, but who wants to pinch pennies when it comes to your face? He is worth every penny and more! It has been over two years since my surgery and the results are still just as amazing!  I am finally getting used to the new attention which can be a little unnerving at times. Last week while I was walking down the beach in Del Mar California, I found myself smiling as a younger gentleman stopped turned around and smiled at me. I can honestly say that I feel more attractive and confident than I did in my thirties!   I have recently become a grandma! Most people comment how young I look for a grandma I smile and explain, I am not as young as I may look.  I cannot express enough gratitude to Dr. Eshima and his staff.

Going to the doctor is inherently stressful for me, so having a pleasant atmosphere and nice company makes a difference.I wish I was as good a patient as Dr. Daphne is a doctor!'),(1969,230,3,'First of all you have to note that they do not take insurance so you have to pay out of pocket, which can add up.

I first came to know about this family practice, grounded in integrative medicine, when I stumbled upon Dr. Daphne Miller\'s book, The Jungle Effect. I was hooked by the nutrition concepts and ideas in her book. Moreover, I came to realize what I needed was a new primary care doctor who was focused on overall wellness not just medicine and who would take a thoughtful approach to my questions and concerns. I found that in the doctors at Wholefamily MD. I previously saw primacy care doctors at UCSF and CPMC. My visits in their offices were conducted using a checklist blood pressure, reflexes, shots required, etc and maybe they would quickly address my medical questions with vague unhelpful answers in a total of 10 minute visits after I waited up to an hour for my appointment. In addition, I had to go to a handful of specialists in addition to my primacy care doctor multiple doctors, who each had a piece of my medical history but who didn\'t know the whole story or who remembered me from visit to intermittent visit. Now I only have to go to Wholefamily MD and am referred to specialists in very few cases. If I do see a specialist, Dr Miller reviews the results too and stays informed. I feel Dr Miller and the other doctors in her practice are better equipped to handle my care and I have trust in them. The Wholefamily MD office staff is helpful as well. For example, I have been able to get in for an appointment on an emergency sameday notice, they have called in prescriptions for me, and I have been able to schedule a phone consultation with the doctor. I was pleasantly surprised to find what was looking for in an integrative medical practice in my neighborhood.'),(1971,230,5,'I have been a patient of Dr. Miller\'s for almost 10 years now and she is, without a doubt, the best physician I could ask for.

Dr. Miller and her colleagues truly care about patient health and wellbeing.'),(1972,230,5,'Dr Miller is a great doctor, takes the time to listen and is very thorough. She is well integrated, will prescribe me a drug as well as tell me to use some holistic remedy. She is very caring and listens and is extremely thorough and knowledgeable.

I think seeing her is a luxury since she does not accept insurance and the visits are very pricey and not always covered.'),(1973,230,5,'Daphne Miller is a godsend.

But every time I\'ve asked her about the details of a suggestion she has made, she has been able to back it up thoroughly. She\'s perfectly willing to use her prescription pad when necessary, but prefers to work with people to make longterm lifestyle improvements and nutritional changes first. Rather than just treating bodies, she\'s treating people.That\'s been great for me, and I recommend her highly.'),(1976,230,4,'I can only give her four stars because I\'ve only met her once, but she came to our house on a Sunday for a home visit to see our infant son one of the other doctors in her practice, Dr. Swan, is my doctor, but she was out of town to check up on his weight gain after the birth. She\'s incredibly knowledgeable, both about holistic medicine and, of course, traditional Western medicine.

Dr. Miller and Dr. Swan share a pager  answering machine that they check after hours for any posthours problems you might have. The office will work with you if you have some emergency to get you seen as soon as you need. I\'m a little bit of a hypochondriac, so it was so good to be able to get sameday reassurance that I wasn\'t dying or hadn\'t contracted some horrible infectious disease.

Dr. Cheung determined I had stress fractures which I could plainly see in the Xray she showed me and a bunion. My right ankle is, as she put it, a mess. It is! She wanted to perform the toe and bunion surgery and wait and see on the ankle. She advised me of the recovery time, and what I would need postsurgery crutches, walking boot, etc..

I get angry when I realize I was misdiagnosed and this problem could have been addressed much sooner.Dr. Cheung is an intelligent, warm, caring physician.

Dr. Cheung explained why and said she absolutely could fix my feet and it wouldn\'t be painful. Well, she was right! My feet are both fixed and the surgeries were not painful.

INSERT INTO `review` VALUES (2027,233,5,'I was seen by Dr. Laroque at her previous location a couple of months ago and have a follow up appointment in a week at her new location.I cannot say enough about Dr. Laroque! Truly the best surgeon I have ever met and spoke with. I have been having tremendous knee pains old sports injuries from 810 years ago and I finally decided to do something about it since I finally had insurance to cover it. I first saw Dr. Ting worked with Barry Bonds and a plethora of other athletes and he was so rude. I tried to explain my issues that I had dislocated my right knee and tendinitis in the left, but he ignored basically what I had to say and just said I need knee replacements, and nothing else could help. I\'m 26 years old mind you, what a waste of time smh.After constantly searching and looking for a great surgeon, I came across Elly Laroque. She basically is a Godsend and by far the best ever. She listened to every single thing I mentioned about my past injuries, gave me a TON of options and said we could try out before surgery. I however, was convinced that after trying everything else prolotherapy, stem cell, etc. that I needed to have this done. Unlike Dr. Ting, Dr. Laroque said that knee replacement wasn\'t even in the question and that I just needed a minor scope or what she calls a buff and shine and will see what else she could do to fix it. I was so relieved that my knee pain would finally be alleviated!After the surgery, Dr. Laroque went over the operation and told me the left knee which I had tendinitis, she noticed that I tore my meniscus as well! No wonder there was so much pain there, I have taken Xrays and MRIs and no Dr. Ting, Kaiser Permanente expert or anyone else knew about that! 2 months later, and I have been going to PT and feel great! I\'m still not there yet physically because there was so much atrophy in the past 810 years from the multiple injuries to both knees but I feel SO MUCH BETTER! If I could give her an 115 stars then I would, she is simply the best of the best!'),(2028,233,5,'Dr LaRoque is a gifted surgeon with an amazing and connected patient manner. With my painful shoulder issues, she explored alternatives to surgery, until we jointly agreed that was the best course of action. Since the procedure, I\'ve recovered better than I could have hoped, thanks to her skill and her working closely with my other health care providers. The world is a better place because of physicians like her.'),(2029,233,5,'Dr. LaRoque is, in a word, impressive. I was referred to her by my physical therapist. Her office and assistant, Sarom, are incredibly efficient. I\'ve never been kept waiting for an appointment, and the billing to my insurance company left me with zero questions, and a nearzero balance. Elly\'s bedside manner is fantastic. She looks you right in the eye, explains all the medical jargon in plain english, and is very thorough in her exams. More importantly, she listens to your questions and concerns, answers them with patience, and recommends courses of action that she herself would take. She\'s everything you would hope for in a surgeon. I\'ve been suffering from pain associated with a separated shoulder and, as her tests concluded, a rotator cuff injury. During my first appointment, she conducted a thorough physical examination of my shoulder, and then walked me through a few different options for treatment before finally recommending the route she would take herselfwhich was surprisingly noninvasive, relying on cortisone, PT and a follow up MRI. After the MRI, I had my second, followup appointment. She studied the test results and images herself, so she could confirm what the imaging center found. She also showed me the images and walked me through what we were seeing, so that I could understand where exactly my pain was originating from. In any event, my films didn\'t reveal any kind of injury that would require surgery to heal, so Elly didn\'t recommend or even suggest surgery for me. I was relievedand happy to have an orthopedist that wasn\'t overly eager to send me to the operating table. I absolutely recommend Dr. LaRoque.'),(2030,233,5,'I met with Dr. Elly LaRoque today after having met with another practitioner in her office who left me feeling helpless and still in pain since October 2012 it\'s almost July 2013. She is a good listener and is efficient, yet she still has great bedside manner. I\'ve seen five different surgeons in three different states for separate issues...so I have an idea of what a good orthopedic surgeon is.Dr. LaRoque saw things on the MRI for my shoulder that the other practitioner didn\'t see, and she did quite a few more assessments to come up with a plan of treatment that I was comfortable with. She shared why a cortizone shot would be the best approach along with some light physical therapy for some bursitis and manageable impingement. I felt really comfortable with her so I said Let\'s do it!.  She was so on point during the appointment that if she recommended surgery, I would have been totally fine with it. She applied the shot soon after making the recommendation the appointment was this afternoon, and we scheduled a follow up. I\'m looking forward to a positive recovery process and updating this review after my shoulder is pain free.'),(2031,233,5,'Dr. Elly LaRoque is the best. She gave me 100% of her attention, explained what to expect and what was going to be done to my shoulder rotator cuff tears. After my surgery Dr. LaRoque called as well as her assistant. My 5 arthroscopic incisions healed to the point that I can only barely see one. She takes workers compensation cases. The office personnel at the Post Street Center and the Corte Madera office are excellent as well. Only one time was the schedule pushed back and they apologized, offered to get me coffee and was genuinely sorry for the wait. I highly recommend Dr. LaRoque.'),(2032,233,5,'I saw Dr. LaRoque today for a shoulder problem. She had come highly recommended by a close friend as well as my primary care physician. They were right. She has a great, caring approach. She is thorough. She explained everything to me clearly and answered every question I had. She explained the treatment options and we decided, together, what we wanted to do to help alleviate the pain I\'ve been experiencing in my shoulder. She specializes in shoulders and knees. So if you ever have any shoulder or knee issues, keep her name handy. It might take a little while to get an appointment with her, but she\'s worth the wait.'),(2033,233,5,'I visited with Dr. LaRoque for what I\'ll describe as a balky, bothersome, stubborn knee problem that wasn\'t quite healing on its own. Dr. LaRoque sent me for an MRI and xray which confirmed what she had suspected, a partial tear of my medial meniscus in my right knee. After explaining my options we both agreed, a partial medial meniscectomy would not only correct the tear but alleviate my discomfort and internal swelling of the knee joint. Just 12 days after surgery, I am about 80% back to normal with about two more weeks before I can go full bore on my right knee. That will mean total recovery in less than a month. I cannot say enough good things about Dr. LaRoque. Not only is she a gifted professional of the highest standards with pinpoint surgical precision, but she\'s a kind, warm, selfless human being, someone I\'d be proud to have as my daughter. She\'s of sound character, who is ethical, straight up and confident. She took the time to explain the mechanics of the knee, how a tear can happen and how it can be repaired surgically. Her approach, at least in my case, was conservative and minimally invasive while achieving its objective. If you\'re looking for a first rate arthroscopic surgeon, go no further.   I\'d be absent minded if I didn\'t mention Dr. LaRoque\'s administrative staff who are all excellent, especially Sarom, who did all of the leg work on my behalf. She scheduled my MRI and surgical appointment, handled the insurance approvals, in short, executed all of the administrative tasks without a hitch.

The knee required cartilage repair to address chrondamalacia and the shoulder addressed extremely painful bursitis and a bone spur. I was nervous beforehand on how long the recovery would be, what the surgery would be like, etc. I was surprised how fast and thorough the surgeries went, and because I had my surgeries on a Wednesday, I only took 3 days off work plus the weekend after surgery to recover. I was able to drive and go back to work the Monday after my surgeries. Also, you will receive pictures andor videos of your surgery, which is good to have handy if your primary physician or physical therapists need to look at them. If you are dedicated to getting better, please go to physical therapy and commit to the exercises. I\'ve had great success going at least 23 days per week. Dr. LaRoque makes sure to call you the evening of your surgery or the next morning to check in on you. My husband was very happy with her professionalism and followup.

I need a reeeeeeeeefill!, Dr. Swan has been a revelation.I don\'t have children, but if I had young daughters in particular, I would rush them in to Dr. Swan because she is so positive about body image and selfacceptance. She is incredibly knowledgeable about alternative medicine as well, and equally creative in her treatment. You know she genuinely cares about you as an individual, and doesn\'t just see you as her next appointment. I travel frequently, and she\'s kept in touch with me via email when I\'ve had issues while out of the country.Brooke H. said it bestshe treats you as a whole beingnot as someone who is short of a preconceived health ideal. When I sometimes don\'t take care of myself, I see genuine concern in her eyes, rather than the tsk tsk, I\'ve gotten from so many practitioners in the past. I am in an HMO for the first time in my life, so reimbursement for my visits is not an option. Nevertheless, I wouldn\'t dream of leaving her for an innetwork doctor. My life and health are worth every penny.Last but not least, I love that she is young, and will not be retiring on me any time soon.'),(2063,234,5,'Like everyone else here, I cannot say enough about Dr Swan and about this practice. We found her when we were searching for a pediatrician for our baby.  We interviewed quite a few doctors. Waited in crowds of people in many cold waiting rooms. Met many overworked late tired doctors. Until we met Dr Swan.The practice is intentionally small and so warm and caring. Dr Swan spends a long time with you  and you feel like you\'re the only thing in her day at that moment. She even made a *housecall* shortly after our girl was born. She\'s stopped by on a *weekend* to test our girl for strep. She responds via *email.* We loved her manner and experience and caring with our girl so much we both dropped our existing arrangements and signed up to have the whole family cared for at this practice.In the meantime, we\'ve seen all three doctors here and the whole practice is great. You have to bill your own insurance  which actually the more we work with it, the more we appreciate. Even in practices that bill insurance directly, I typically have forms and followups  it doesn\'t seem any more of a burden here, and what the office saves in the confines of that insurance hassle, they return many times in personal attention and care.I would not hesitate to recommend anyone to Dr Swan and to this practice.'),(2064,234,5,'Dr. Swan is the best, most attentive, caring, wholeperson treating doctor I\'ve ever had. She\'s got an unusual mix of being a topeducated doctor plus a kind, empathetic human being. I have never felt so well taken care of, and she answers emails and I understand she even does house calls if the situation warrants. The best feeling is going there and knowing she\'s treating your whole being  if I have one ailment somewhere, she still checks in on progress with other issues, and by the end of the 30 or 45 minutes, I feel so well attended to!It\'s a bummer that she doesn\'t take health insurance, but I couldn\'t even being to imagine switching to a different doctor.'),(2065,234,5,'Just want to post something as a patient and a physician: Dr. Swan is remarkable: smart, caring and inspiring. It doesn\'t get any better than her. She knows her stuff well and is perfectly and appropriately confident to be able to say when she should or wants to learn more about a particular subject. You should know that you are in terrific hands with her care.'),(2066,234,5,'Ditto what everyone else has said. On top of that, I will just add, that after 10 years in the Bay Area, the best I could say about any doctor I\'d had and I\'ve had more than a couple is that I was ambivalent about them. I didn\'t think they were great and I still felt like a number, but at least they didn\'t seem incompetent. The worst I could say about several cannot be printed here! Then I heard about this practice. I researched it and only heard good things and even knew two people that saw doctors there that had only rave reviews. Still, I debated long and hard. First of all, I live in the East Bay and wasn\'t thrilled about the idea of having to cross the bridge and battle SF parking just to see a doctor. Second, the whole no insurance thing was a bit of a turn off. But I finally got so fed up with my docs that I decided I had to try it. I\'m SO glad I did!Dr. Swan is a dream. I\'ve never felt so cared for by a doctor. Even for routine stuff, you won\'t be ushered into the waiting room, given a perfunctory once over and shoved out after five minutes with a prescription. She actually spends time with you! She actually gets to know your lifestyle. She\'s not just about giving you a pill which I like, instead, she makes practical suggestions for lifestyle changes. She had me tested for things that no other doctor had ever tested me for and got some really important results about low vitamin and mineral levels. And I absolututely LOVE it that she gives you a written summary of all her recommendations when you leave because I can never remember that stuff after the fact. Now I don\'t have to. Is she more expensive? Yes. Especially depending on your insurance. I\'m lucky that mine pays 70% of her fee some insurance doesn\'t pay for out of network at all, but that can still add up. Still, I\'d go to her even if I had to pay the full fee myself. After having some fairly serious health concerns over the last couple of years and dealing with doctors that I didn\'t think gave a toss about me or who, even worse, made me feel like an idiot for asking questions, I\'ve realized that having a doctor that you\'re in sync with is SO important. She\'s worth every single penny. I wish all doctors were like her.'),(2067,234,5,'I can honestly say I have the BEST DOCTOR... I\'ve been seeing her almost a year often once a week when needed. She\'s been nothing but awesome. I don\'t need to explain why except to say that I like going to see her despite the long drive. I have other people on my health team & she works with them too. I can\'t say enough how wonderful she is as a doctor & a person.'),(2068,234,5,'Dr. Swan is now my son\'s pediatrician as well as my doctor, and I\'m so happy to have her nearby. She takes the time to answer all questions, no matter how sillynewparent they are, and has a really great way of passing information along. I have great memories of my doctor when I was little, so I\'m thrilled to have her and her partners in the practice to take care of my family. This is the kind of family practice I used to fantasize about, and it\'s great to know it exists!'),(2069,234,5,'having read all the other comments, everything good about Dr. Swan and her office is covered ... will just add that she\'s been our 5yr old\'s doc since the kid\'s birth, and we\'ve been extremely happy with it. In fact, soon after signing on with Doc Swan for the kid, both wife & I made the switch to her as our primary doc. A bit more expensive, as insurance typically only covers these visits at 80% and, you have to file the paperwork yourself, but well worth it.'),(2070,234,5,'Our family has seen Dr. Swan for five years. She is one of the kindest, most understanding people we have ever met, She has been open when we have been hesitant. She has always made herself available, even when inconvenient to her own schedule. She is by far the best doctor we have ever known. She is our entire family\'s MD and I cannot praise her or recommend her enoughshe is one of the most wonderful and amazing people I have ever met and I feel privileged to be a client.'),(2071,234,5,'We had a number of doctors but have stopped looking now that we found Dr Swan. She is caring and knowledgeable and our daughter loves to visit her.'),(2072,234,5,'My wife and I initially discovered Dr Swan in 2004 when we were looking for a family doctor for our kid who was about to be born. At that time, when meeting with and interviewing multiple doctors, we were most impressed with her because she was the most relaxed and spent the most time with us and didn\'t charge us for the meeting. After our baby was born she made a house visit wow! that was SO easy and nice! and talked about the health of all of us, both parents and the baby, not just the baby. I was blown away with how much attention and time she spent. Since then, she\'s made quick house visits to drop off something or get a quick test on a weekend, and she\'s become the doctor for our whole family, not just our kid. She\'s a gem. I haven\'t had a doctor like her since I moved to San Francisco. She or the other doctor in the office are the ones who answer your page on offhours, not some nurse at an 800 number. She replies to email quickly. She listens, she spends time, she pays attention, she doesn\'t condescend, she doesn\'t rush you, she doesn\'t try to pressure you, she mades smart recommendations, she responds with compassion to each and every concern, even if it\'s completely silly or petty, and, most of all, she\'s very smart and is interested in our whole selves and whole family, not just the specific symptom or situation. Her office will print out a claim form for you to mail to your insurance if your insurance will pay for an outofnetwork doctor which makes it easy for us to pay Dr Swan then file claim for reimbursement from our insurance. I\'d pay for her services even if my insurance didn\'t cover outofnetwork. She\'s that fabulous.'),(2073,234,5,'Dr. Swan is the best  going to her office is more like visiting a spa or a therapist than a doctors office. You leave feeling refreshed and soothed  nothing like it.'),(2074,234,5,'Dr. Swan is the type of doctor that I just assumed didn\'t exist anymore. We\'ve been seeing her since my daughter was born in 05, originally just taking my daughter to her, but the whole family has since switched to her. It is so nice to know you are going to see her and not whoever is on rotation at UCSF, which is what we did for years. She has made house calls on numerous occasions and the first time my daughter had an ear infection she was there for hours in the middle of the night. You do have to pay out of pocket though which is a bummer, but they do all the insurance paperwork for you so you just mail it in. And I agree with a previous post, she is just a wonderful person. Oh an I am a person who will always look at all the alternative options to something and she has ALWAYS been very understanding and open to that and doesn\'t make me feel crazy like every other doctor I\'ve seen does, which means a ton.'),(2075,234,5,'So, if you\'re willing to pay extra for a general practitioner who doesn\'t take insurance, pick Avril.

Number one sleeze bag! He never discussed those calls with me and his whole demeanor changed after those calls. He started to ask me very personal questions at weird times throughout the day.

I was emotionally and physically spent.From the first visit, he explained that we would chip away at the pain on multiple fronts, both pharmaceutical and interventional. This approach has managed my pain so significantly, that I am now beginning to enjoy a quality of life that I feared was lost to me forever. The way Dr Bartoli conducts his practice is almost nonexistent in today\'s health care climate. He is patient, compassionate, accessible, skilled and highly intelligent. Despite the demands of private practice, he manages to stay abreast of the scholarly articles being published in the field of pain management, so I feel very well informed and appreciate that he takes the time to help me stay educated and up to date..

I appreciate the fact that he did not do what the Pain Specialists in my home town of West Palm Beach would have done, by prescribing highly addictive narcotics that would not fixed my problem, only blurred my perception.If you need a good pain management doctor, he is, in my opinion, worth checking out.

When asked to explain a medical term he used in layman\'s terms, he decided not to respond and just said, well, it\'s nothing to worry about.

There were some good things about his practice: very nice office, he was able to fit us in the same day if we had an emergency.However, when he saw us, he really rushed us through the appointment. He first gave shots to our baby and then asked do you have any questions. After the shots! : we just wanted to leave the office and calm our baby down at that point. He was cold with us and our daughter. Actually, I wrote a review on yelp about him once I knew we were moving and had to look for a different doctor. I didn\'t use my real name. He made sure to find out who wrote that review and started emailing us directly about my review. That was VERY CREEPY! I was so disappointed with the whole experience that I deleted my account and all reviews from Yelp. Since then, we have found a different doctor for our daughter and I couldn\'t be happier with her.And it amuses me to see Dr. Simons\' staff used to be just his wife to call all notsopositive reviews as slanderous e.g., false accusations. Frankly, I\'m very surprised there are so many 5star reviews for him and almost all 13 star reviews are either completely removed from his profile or are filtered out including mine.'),(2102,236,5,'Dr. Simons has been our pediatrician for only a month now, but he\'s been great.

Dr. Simons was extremely patient and helpful as our older son worked through his fear of the doctor, and was thorough and engaged despite our little guy\'s screams and wiggles.

Each has a huge computer monitor where he can show you your baby\'s growthprogress. He keeps his records online how techforward!, which is very convenient and cuts down on papershuffling time when you have a question. His office also has a regular waiting room and a separate sick waiting room to keep sick & healthy kids apart.

Of course this isn\'t for the diagnosis of anything serious, but sometimes you just need a realitysanity check without a visit. Questions like what\'s the best way to get this pill into my baby\'s body or should I be concerned about slight mottling of his skin after a brisk walk outside, advice on baby products  formula  overthecounter medicines.

He referred us to an amazing surgeon at Oakland Children\'s the same day and within two weeks of that visit our son had surgery to correct the problem. Had Dr. Simons not caught this issue early, which many pediatricians do not, our son would have had to undergo a much more invasive procedure with a much longer and harder recovery.

His new pediatrician was very talkative, so much that she forgot to administer a test for hemoglobin and sent us home. And her lack of confidence emerged when she readily jumped to medicating my son rather than advising us on wait and see approach for an ear infection when he showed no signs of discomfort, agitation or fever.

Outside of our well baby visits every three months, we called our doctor two times. At first, we really liked Dr. Simons a lot more than Dr. Langston who seemed aloof and inattentive . Then things didn\'t go so well. I wrote this letter to Dr. Simons following our last visit with him:Dear Dr. Simons,On January XX, 2008 Mommy Dragon brought our oneyear old son Baby Dragon to your office so that you could evaluate and treat his index finger that was injured in an elevator door the night before. It was swollen and lacerated in several places.  You sent him for xrays and told Mommy Dragon that you would call her shortly with an evaluation.You never called. Both Mommy Dragon and I called your office numerous times over the next three days but you never took the time to talk to us. You were always unavailable, or busy. I\'m not even sure that you reviewed his xray. You finally called the following Monday afternoon, on the 29th. On the phone and in your note to us you stated that you thought that the info had been passed to us. Whom did you think had passed the info on to us? I\'m sure you know, xray technicians are prohibited from giving patients a diagnosis and I hope you didn\'t expect one of the receptionists to give us a diagnosis. We were expecting to hear about his condition from you, his doctor.Most disturbing of all is that you never even took off the bandages to look at Baby Dragon\'s finger. It\'s possible that some sort of medical intervention might have been helpful stitches or Dermabond. We brought Baby Dragon to you so that you could examine his injured finger but for some reason, you decided not to do that. There was no way you could determine the severity of his injuries without removing the bandages that covered his entire finger and actually looking at his finger. Baby Dragon will possibly have permanent scars from this accident.Sadly, we no longer trust you as Baby Dragon\'s doctor, and need to find another pediatrician. Please send us all of Baby Dragon\'s medical records, charts, immunization records, and physicians notes. If you have any of Baby Dragon\'s medical information in electronic format please send those to littledragon\'s email address. In addition, we want you to return the $15.00 we paid you for services that were never rendered.'),(2112,236,5,'We love Dr. Simons.

He has a wonderful bedside manner and I\'ve consistently found him to be smart, approachable, knowledgable and completely up on the latest thinking and research around issues like vaccinations and immunizations which as you probably know is a hot topic these days.

She contracted RSV we didn\'t know it at the time and we had no pediatrician in the area and were traveling from Modesto to SF. We called friends in Marin and SF to get in to see their Pediatricians because our daughter had a 102 fever. Many wouldn\'t see us then a friend suggested Dr. Simons and gave us his number. He evaluated our daughter that day when there are emergencies sometimes you have to wait for well visits and the Dr. may fall a bit behind on schedule, duh and sent us to CPMC to have more tests. Everything ended up great and he was an absolute savior for our family and our stress levels with our first baby.

And his response time is incredible. Personally, I\'ve never experienced such high quality nor such personalized care before, but I\'m thrilled to have found it for our baby.To illustrate my point: Late on a Friday, I decided I HAD to contact Dr. Simons about a rash on my son\'s belly, rather than wait out the whole weekend wondering if he had a flesheating disease. Dr.Simons returned my call within the hour and asked me to email him a photo of my son\'s rash. After viewing it and determining it not only didn\'t warrant a visit, it was in fact harmless, he emailed us back right away. When we failed to respond to his email and since he had to run to the hospital to see another patient Dr. Simons had his secretary call us to verify we\'d gotten the all clear, and texted me himself to follow up and guarantee my peace of mind.Needless to say, our son will be a loyal patient of Dr. Simon\'s until he goes to college.'),(2122,236,5,'Dr. Simons has made a huge difference in the health of our 2year old son.

He goes beyond what I expect in a SF doctor: on more than one occasion he has squeezed us in for lastminute worry visits e.g., slight fever; moreover, late one night we took our daughter to the afterhours clinic, and the next morning Dr. Simons called us to check in and see how she was doing. We didn\'t even tell him we had gone. He\'s young, so of course he also makes great use of technology.Dr. Simons\'s new office is very unlike the typical SF doctor\'s office that makes you feel sicker, germier and more depressed than you were when you arrived. It has two separate entrances and waiting rooms one for well kids and one for sick kids, the exam rooms look and feel like cozy rooms in your own home only clean, and the waiting rooms are spacious and warm with bowls of apples and toys that look clean and are too large to go into little mouths e.g., rocking horse.

Truth is they are both great doctors. A good doctor is hard to find, especially a good pediatrician to take care of your little one.

Everyone\'s experiences are different and yours could be different. Parents give good reviews or bad reviews depending on what kind of parent they are and what their expectations are. With that said, I believe that if you are a modern parent, you\'ll probably like having Dr. Simons. why?1. Your time is valuable, get in, get out. done. You are a self checkout at the grocery store kind of person.2. Want quicker results. He tends to prescribe medication when Dr Langston would not.3. You don\'t need a lot of explanation on vaccines, medication, conditions because you can do your own research and already know the medical jargon.4. You can handle his dry sense of humor and don\'t mind if his quick short responses.5. You like people who do everything by the book .6. You want someone who cares more about your child\'s physical health more than anything else.7. You like the sense of urgency.If you are more traditional you\'ll probably like Dr. Langston better. why?1. Explains things to you, doesn\'t assume you know it already.2. Generally does not prescribe medication unless it is necessary.3. Tends to take things slower 4. Makes sure you have no questions before leaving the office. handouts, etc...5. Focuses on putting child and parent at ease.6. Has more experience and cares about your child\'s health.Notice I did not mention anything about the office decor and stuff as they are not as important to me what toys they have.So, did I choose? nope, my child chose for us.

After our first few visits with our 2nd daughter I wasn\'t entirely sold on Dr. Simons bedside manner. I thought he was too abrupt and dependant on bright toys to distract the child. I compared him to our more gentle previous physician. That Dr. was my husbands pediatrician as well, so he had many more years to refine his manner. Our previous Dr. also had 4 grown children. His knowledge of children went beyond what you could learn at medical school. Back to Dr. Simons. Now that we have been with Simons for two years, and had yet another child that makes 3 I can give you a more accurate review. My middle child used to scream bloody murder leaving our house to go to his office, and have a full conniption fit once we arrived. She is now very happy to go to Dr. Simons and I would even go as far as saying they are buds. He has more direct contact with his patient\'s families then any other physician I have met and doesn\'t depend on his front office to do his communicating. He doesn\'t over schedule his day and you will never spend more then a couple of minutes in his waiting room. Our children have warmed up to him and he has a genuine relationship with them.

That\'s a no brainer.What isn\'t obvious and relevant in this particular case is that most of the items and services with ludicrous charges are not covered by insurance to begin with. The doctor can charge whatever they want for these. I went in three or four times before I realized what this guy was doing. Each time I was given a choice: a service covered by insurance, or a service that was new that was not that I would have to pay the doctor directly for out of pocket. The former was frequently presented as out of date or not entirely effective, while the latter was presented as the greatest thing or far more effective. Somehow, my insurance now only covered a portion of my testing and I would have to pay the remainder. I\'ve been getting the same tests with the same insurance every time that I have moved in the past five years 4x. This is the only time that I had to pay an extra $250. Like many others, I trusted my doctor\'s professional opinion and went for the option that was presented as more effective when given a choice. I didn\'t even think that this guy could be taking a bigger cut until I spoke with a family friend physician in another state.I can\'t put myself in this guy\'s head. I\'m not going to expose myself to slander or libel and claim he\'s out to screw us all over, just like I know that he would never violate HIPAA and post anything that further identified me. I do know, however, that if a doctor were to push for a treatment solution that offered a vastly greater financial incentive for them for only a marginal improvement in efficacy for the patient, then that particular doctorpatient relationship has decayed into a salesmanconsumer relationship.I\'m gaining nothing by writing this review.

My last review was for a really good burrito place I mean, come on.While you are doing that take a look at reviews for other medical specialists the fact that this guy has to come on here and defend himself so frequently should tell you something.'),(2134,237,2,'So here is why I gave two stars: When I received my EOB statement from Health Net PPO, he billed me for $420 for NOTHING! I already paid $120 for those pricks! And he could NOT figure out what was causing my problem, so I still got that allergy after the appointment. I was just so upset to pay such a high fee for nothing. This is just way too much and the American medical system just sucks! My nose was congested most of the time during that couple of months and some days I just used a whole big box of Kleenex in a day! My allergy was so bad that I couldn\'t stand it anymore, so I searched for an allergist thru my medical carrier\'s innetwork doctors. But there were SO many results and I didn\'t know who was good. So I went to Yelp to look for reviews before I picked one. I picked Dr. Reid based on the 4 star reviews and gave it a try at his office. After the appointment and received my EOB statement from Health Net PPO, here is what I think: Pricks: I had to pay for the cost of pricks UP FRONT, they charge $10 each prick. I did 12 pricks so that costs me $120. I am a first timer at an allergist\'s office, so I had no idea what a prick was before. So here it is: A prick is for one test of allergen. One prick for dust mite, one prick for pollen, one prick for dogs, one prick for cats, etc. Their office staff: friendly and was able to answer my questions. Dr. Reid is very easy to talk to and very friendly. He asked me a bunch of general questions like family medical history, where I live and the kind of house I am in for locationrelated allergen?, my personal medical history. After the initial questions, he thought it might be the dust mite that caused my allergy. He recommended me to take 20+ pricks and I asked why should I do that? After some questions back and forth, he dropped this 20+ to 12. Come on, it is $10 per prick! This figure seems arbitrary, and it seems to me that this doctor is trying to get patients more pricks even tho they may not need them. Then someone else came in to the room and gave me those 12 pricks.My test result: I am NOT allergic to dust mite. At the end of my appointment, he couldn\'t figure out what was causing my problem and he just gave me some nose spray that I could just purchase at Walgreen! I think ALL medical practicesoffice should disclose their fees to patients BEFORE they make appointments. How hard could that be to disclose fees on their web site? If we are the payor, don\'t we have the right to know what we are getting ourselves into first?'),(2135,237,2,'Really bad experience with visit and billing.I have had allergy for years, and it recently seems to get worse after moving to the Bay Area. I have had tested on allergy before dust mites, but was tempted with the idea of getting allergy shots this time. After some research, I decided to go to Dr. Reid based on great Yelp reviews. His assistant told me that it would only take about an hour.However, my experience is far from satisfactory. Dr. Reid was nice to talk to, if it\'s in a bar, but a lot of our initial 45 minutes conversation was chitchat and essentially boiled down to the conclusion: I might have indoor allergy, probably of dust mite and mole, and should be tested... Fine.Then when it comes to actually allergy testing, I waited 20 minutes to be informed by the nurse that they forgot to test one thing on me...dust mite. So I have to again be pricked another time and wait another 20 minutes, and then doctor was not there. 30 minutes...40 minutes...and still not there. He could be heard talking about some exciting trip with another patient down the hall way, while I was there lying on the bed, topless in a chilly Friday, for more than an hour.When he finally made it to my room, it\'s already almost 2 hours into my appointment. And the result was exactly what I told him an hour and half ago... Fast forward two weeks, when I got letter form my insurance company, not only did they try to charge me twice for the office visit which I already paid while being at the office, but they were also charging me allergy testing of 60 allergens while I was tested on 20...Overall, horrible experience throughout. Maybe I\'m the long tail case, but I would recommend to put some time buffer and double check your bill if you want to go here...'),(2136,237,1,'I would NEVER recommend this place if you have allergy issues.

When people are miserable with allergies, I am not! I have recommended 2 friends to see him and they both loved him. He is friendly and really listens. He has a ton of experience, which is what I want in an MD. Also, we were thinking about leaving the Bay Area at some point for Colorado so he looked into what allergens were like in Colorado to ensure I was injected against them too.

I have been living with allergies for several years now and it seems to get worse each year. I was previously seeing another allergist in the FiDi but wasn\'t too happy with him because I felt as if my concerns weren\'t answered. So what did I do? Of course, I went to Yelp.com to find an allergist and came across Dr. Reid\'s office. After a couple of weeks of bad allergies, I was ready for anything that would help me alleviate my allergies.Dr. Reid\'s office is conveniently located in the Financial District, close to my office which is great! After checking in @ the front desk, I knew immediately the folks in this office would take great care of me! They were warm, inviting and informative. Dr. Reid took his time with me and asked questions. He was extremely patient and made me feel at ease! I was nervous about getting allergy shots and he answered any concerns I had. They performed an allergy test which was quick and painless. Linh I hope I spelled it right, one of his staff members was awesome, took my vitals and helped me with the breathing test. She also made me feel at ease and answered any questions I had. I will sign up for allergy tests with his office and this time I will definitely follow through with the shots.

I never even began receiving my allergy shot treatment and the office has continued to bill me for over three years for shots I never got!. A year ago, I sent a letter and spoke with billing department to sort out the situation and to confirm that indeed I was NOT getting the shots. I paid up with them because I am an honest patient and didn\'t want any open bills. The confirmed they would no longer send me bills.Here I am again, receiving bills for shots I never received. AND; the last billing statements I got? 2 versions of the same bill. I just spoke with the receptionist and she stated, Oh, disregard the second one. We sent out 2 this month. What? Also be cautious, bills are generated up to 6 months after services rendered which in my case I never got.Ugh; I have enough to deal with than incompetent billing systems and shady policies.Looks like the I am not the only one with this complaint. I see another Yelper just went through the same exact situation and had to go to BBB which is my next step as well.I\'ve filed a BBB case and opened a claim inquiry with my Insurance company as well.UPDATE: 62011Despite Dr. Reid\'s updated billing department per his personal message, I continue to receive bills for allergy services I never received!

An important clarification: It is not correct that the BBB found Dr. Reid\'s office to not be at fault. I TERMINATED the BBB inquiry myself. In a phone conversation with Dr. Reid\'s billing department we agreed that if they stopped billing me erroneously I would drop the BBB complaint, and so I did, that very day in September 2009, and then continued to receive bills from them for months and months into 2010.

And, I was in their office and they didn\'t even notify me inperson of this change in billing policy.Last week I received a phone call from Dr. Reid\'s billing department after I had written the Yelp review. I was not rude with them, but simply tried to get a quick resolution to my complaint and confirmation that they would stop sending me erroneous bills. Their tone was very unprofessional with me.

After waking up in my hotel room looking like I was getting ready to star in the next big production horror movie, I thought to myself that I better get checked out before the day is over. So when I got into our satellite office in downtown SF, I logged onto the Aetna website to look for an allergy specialist in my network because I\'m not paying for a out of network doctor. The closest allergy doctor that came up from the office was Dr. Reid so I got on the phone to see if they could squeeze me in towards the end of the workday. They had an opening at 3:00 PM so I took it.When I walked into Dr. Reid\'s office, it was nothing special, just a plain typical medical office, but clean and tidy. I was promptly greeted by the receptionist. Filled out a couple of forms, let them make a copy of my insurance cardID and was told to wait. I was brought back to the room by a very nice medical assistant who took my vitals and asked me a few questions. I was left alone until the PA entered the room. There was a knock and when the door opened, Janel, the PA greetedme. All I could think about after seeing Janel was holy smokes, a Physician Assistant hotter than Reshma Shetty does exists and in real life no doubt. So I showed her my symptoms and told her all the crap that I ate during the previous 24 hour period. She listened, took notes, and offered an opinion when needed. She also laughed as I was jokingly describing my symptoms and boy was her smile beautiful. But the best part was she was extremely knowlegable and informative. After getting a few food allergies it turned out somehow I\'ve now developed an allergy to walnuts. Janel then gave me a prescription for Epipen and fill me on more information. The care at Dr. Reid\'s office was fast and just plan awesome. I had a great experience for a first time visit and hopefully the only time to an Allergy Office. Filling the script at the nearby Walgreen is whole other story.In conclusion, if you get a case of the heebee geebee hives like I did or have any other allergic reaction, make an appointmentwith Janel. Let me know if you were right about Janel, not only was she hot but she also had the brains to go with her looks. Unfortunately I noticed that she had a ring on and lives in a different area code.'),(2144,237,5,'Amazing! This was my first visit to a allergist.

After moving to California in the late 90\'s, however, I experienced seven glorious allergyfree years.Little did I know that allergies evolve over time.After spending about two weeks absolutely unable to breathe through my nose due to extreme congestion, I made the appointment. What immediately struck me about Dr. Reid was the amount of time we spent talking before any testing took place or drugs were administered. I have NEVER spent that much time just talking to a medical professional who didn\'t happen to be a friend. Usually you get your insurance companymandated 7 minutes speeddating session, they write a scrip or run a test, and you\'re outta there. Completely the opposite experience here.Over the course of about 40 minutes, Dr. Reid essentially asked me my life story where I\'d lived, where I\'d visited, the kinds of recreational activities I participated in, my living situation married, dog, cat, 80yrold house, no kids, and how my allergies had changed over the years.

And when I say no problems, I mean none no sneezing, no itchiness, no watery eyes, nothing.Then came the testing. And guess what... He nailed it. The man actually guessed it exactly right, including the cat part for which they actually tested me twice, just to be sure. Moreover, living with the offending feline had induced some mild asthma. Decision time: say goodbye to Magic or find a way to manage my allergy.I took option two I love that cat, which means immunotherapy. And I can honestly say that it works as advertised. Within a few months, most of my ongoing allergy symptoms were gone, and now, years later, I only get a touch of hay fever once in a while.My only gripe with the office is that they NEED free WiFi.

I got a prescription for an epipen and some high does antihistamines and was told to contact him if they ever came back. Luckily, they didn\'t for over a 1.5 years. Then, recently, I had 2 very strange eye swellings in the same eye. The second one sent me to the ER again for throat swelling although it could have just been that I was panicking and scared. In any case, I went back to see Dr. Reid, he did an environmental allergen test nothing really popped up, and we\'re currently waiting for lab results for other testing. I\'ve felt incredibly anxious throughout this process of not knowing what is going on with me and Dr. Reid has been nothing but nice and comforting. He sat with me at my appt. for as long as I wanted, took notes, and answered all my questions never making me feel rushed or silly for anything I was asking.

He was in agreement with what I suspected but advised a contrast MRI, which is what I was hoping he\'d do, rather than tell me to do rehab, rest, etc. The MRI results weren\'t 100% black and white, so he wanted to try an injection in hopes of pain relief but also as a diagnostic tool. The injection worked wonders. Immediately after the injection, he said it\'d be sore it was for a few days and to rest about 48 hrs, then slowly begin trying to do the things that previously I couldn\'t due to the pain. Those were the exact words I wanted to hear!! A month later, I\'m back to practicing yoga without any modifications!What I really found refreshing about Dr. Colyvas was that he didn\'t discredit my opinions about what I thought was going on. Instead, he respected my years of experience and knowledge in my field. Furthermore, he didn\'t tell me to stop doing what I loved.

It would make my decade if she opened up an East Bay office.My kids\' health and well being are beyond a priority to me I\'m sure most parents can relate and we always feel heard and taken seriously at Getzwell. Hourlong appointments mean you\'re not rushed. Ontime appointments mean you and your kids aren\'t going batty in the waiting room. Speaking of waiting rooms, their entire office both locations is beautifully and thoughtfully designed. And most importantly, they really care about kids\' health and it shows. They follow up. They ask good questions. They want your kids to thrive.Yes, it costs a little more, but we are talking about a child\'s health here. It is so so important and I would trade in daily lattes and housekeepers neither of which we ever had in a heartbeat. If you can swing it, and have a decent PPO, it is worth every extra penny. Besides, the costs are not much different after year 2 when visits are annual. We signed up with them when my youngest was 6 months and I regret not starting with them from the get go.

Of course, mainly, so that I don\'t have to hear about magical benefits of vaccination. So, I was very disappointed that they are very provaccine and i\'d say pretty pushy. They obviously don\'t know their audience, I\'m kind of surprised they are still ih business.Regarding my visit, I had a well baby visit with one of their nurse practitioners. She wasn\'t very supportive of me breastfeeding my toddler who\'s not even 2 yet and even APA recommends nursing until 2!. She advised a sleep training that obviously I could have done by now if I was in support of it, and finally started telling me of benefits of vaccination. All in all, I felt as I was ripped off.

I feel so blessed to have someone as amazing and intelligent about pediatricsholistic medicine as her. I was able to meet her when I was pregnant with my daughter 5 years ago. I immediately was taken by her very kind demeanor. The thing I liked about her philosophy the most was how she took in the whole picture of wellness. It wasn\'t just about care when there is illness, but how to live in a more healthy way; eating organically, using green household products, etc. She encouraged healthy supplements and homeopathy too. I respected her views of vaccines since she saw first hand the effects of some of these illness on very young children. She supports delayed vaccination and most importantly she respects each family\'s beliefs whether or not they choose to vaccinateshe will never judge a family.  My husband and I had a meet and greet with her and she was very warm and caring. She was extremely probreastfeeding The birth with my daughter was challenging and had some complications. Julia made a home visit after we were came back from the hospital and was very positive and very concerned after what we went through. She helped me immensely with breastfeeding and I was able to do it until my daughter was well into 3. I would of never been able to do this without her full support. She was also very monumental in my healing from my difficult childbirth. She was able to suggest a supplemental regimen that really helped me regain my strength. Julia also has given so much time to our family; hour long appointments, emails, and phone calls. We\'ve never felt that she was unavailable to the care of our daughter. When she was sick, Julia really listen to our concerns and we were able to figure out solutions together. She also was able to ease my fears and anxiety when things came up. I can see it was important to her that we were heard and included in our daughters care. Because of her, my daughter is a very happy and healthy little girl. She absolutely loves Julia.

She doesn\'t just slap a bandaid on the problem. She looks for the root. Also, prevention is a key component for her. She does not over react nor does she underreact. Both of my children have been different from the norm in their own ways, and she has been able to see them as individuals and not just plots on a graph.She is versed in things most pediatricians don\'t have any training in: breastfeeding, infant and child psychology, discipline, nutrition, raising a greentoxinfree family, homeopathy, etc. Some of my friends leave their pediatricians office needing to do their own research about therapies or recommendations that are given, trying to make sure it is the right thing for their kid. I have never once had to do that with Dr. Getzleman. She explains her rationale, offers alternatives, and I leave completely confident that I have made the right choice.One of the things that enables Dr. Getzleman to provide this level of service involves having to submit your own bills to insurance and paying a membership fee. But when I weigh the cost of that next to the health of my children and the comfort and care they feel there, it feels very balanced.One of the biggest endorsements I can give is that my children ASK to go to the pediatrician. They love going to see Dr. Getzleman. I cannot say enough about her. One of the things that keeps me in SF is her office. If I had to move, one of the worst things would be leaving Getzwell.

They care and ask about everything safety, sleep, eating, behaviors, etc beside doing physical checkups. They spend a lot of time with us, listen with genuine care and also provide good answers, and even if they don\'t know of one at that moment, they would research and follow up within the same day.They are prompt in getting back to me whenever I call with an issue.

Dr. Getzelman immediately told us to come in because she was equally concerned. She arranged for us to take my daughter into the ER and told us what to expect regarding hospital stay and neurological tests. Thanks to her, our daughter was correctly diagnosed and put on the proper medication and is now thriving. Dr. Getzelman was also very supportive of me, checking in with how I was holding up, which I appreciated because when your newborn baby has an unknown condition it is the scariest thing in the world.Her practice does not take insurance, and her website explains why, and it makes complete sense. Because of our daughter\'s health issues, we have decided to continue with Dr. Getzelman even though our insurance is not covering anything due to a very high deductible. Dr. Getzelman listens to me and supports many of my decisions, which include cosleeping, breastfeeding, and introducing whole foods rather than rice cereal for starting solids.

Dr. Getzelman is the real deal!'),(2232,240,5,'I have been using Yelp almost since its inception and have never been compelled to write review or join until recently. My wife and I have recently welcomed our second child into our family. We had been seeing a pediatrician near our home in the Richmond with our first son for his first 8 years. We expected with the arrival of our second son that we would continue at this practice as it was convenient, accepted our insurance, and always provided a decent level of care. It seemed right from the first visit with our newborn we became at odds with the care we were going to receive for our newborn. Our first visit barely lasted 10 minutes and the physician\'s primary area of concern was on our desire for an alternative vaccination schedule not our son\'s health. Additionally, we asked some basic questions regarding the vaccinations that were going to be given to our son and unfortunately both the NP and physician couldn\'t answer basic questions about the additives or ideas about using a delayed vaccine schedule. Pretty scary stuff is you ask me. We had one more visit, which pretty much went the same way as the first. It seemed as though the practice was more about imposing their ideas on our son and us rather than listening to our concerns and needs. We ended up getting recommended to GetzWell by some friends who raved about the practice. After our first visit we could see that this was a profoundly different type of practice. It was warm, welcoming, informative, and exceeded all of our expectations. Our first visit lasted well over 30 minutes and delved into all aspects of our newborn\'s health and that of my wife\'s. Her staff was able to answer all of questions quite intelligently and compassionately. Initially, we were a little hesitant to switch over given that they don\'t accept insurance and it would be an additional cost for both our children especially since our insurance has a fairly high deductible and we work in the public sector. In the end, if you break it down, yes it\'s more than your typical practice, but the level of care and service you receive is far beyond anything you will find anywhere else. And in our eyes an extra expense for our children\'s health is certainly worth it.'),(2233,240,5,'My wife and I have been interviewing pediatricians and after leaving GetzWell I know that we have found our doctor. Her clinic is only a couple blocks from our house and every time we walk by we notice what a well designed & creative place she had created. I finally had a chance to meet with her and I can say that Dr. Getzelman is a truly integrative pediatrician which I think is very difficult to find in San Francisco. She is at once warm and inviting, and quick and definitive. I think this kind of balance is difficult to find in a physician so I feel like meeting her is a total score. She spoke to the incredible importance of food and diet and how that impacts child development. My wife and I are very committed to health so she was saying all of the right things.  I think she will be a tremendous guide for us throughout the whole journey.'),(2234,240,4,'I went to the Getzwell clinic to have my 10 month old daughter\'s ears pierced. After much research, I found two possible locations that met my criteria. One was what seems to be an extremely popular and insanely expensive practice for infant ear piercings and the other was Getzwell. I went with Getzwell due to the price $100 including earrings! and the piercing was going to be completed by Emily Waight, a Certified Pediatric Nurse Practitioner.I called to schedule my appt and they were able to see us even though we were not \'official\' members of their practice. During the appt everything occurred just as they explained it would. I chose the earrings that were gold plated, which isnt a big deal to me as I plan on changing them as soon as I am able to, and they came in a sealed sterile package. The ears are pierced with the earring and the equipment used to push the earring through not sure what its called is also sterile, as it is only used one time..

After discussing all the different factors and conducting a careful examination, she was able to eliminate all of the potential worst case possibilities and then thoroughly explained to us what to expect with the fever and how to handle it. We were in and out within an hour, Rx in hand, and were incredibly relieved! Dr. Getzelman called over the weekend to make sure everything was ok. Unheard of!! We returned for a follow up on Monday and had a similarly positive experience with Dr. Nasta. Both of our visits were beyond our expectations. I gotta move to the City, for my baby\'s sake.'),(2249,240,5,'We are so lucky to have Dr. Getzleman and Dr. Nasta as our pediatricians. Not only to they provide excellent heath care, but they also have classes on parenting and a marriage counselor on staff if you need it. They are available 247, and not afraid to prescribe the natural remedy if it\'s suitable. This is a great practice!'),(2250,240,5,'i\'ll preface this first by saying i hardly ever give a 5 star rating. 4 stars is very good in my book.one thing i always felt at our former pediatrician\'s office was the sense of limited time. she would answer questions, but she definitely needed to make it brief. also the place seemed a bit too crowded at times. sometimes i\'d wonder what we were getting exposed to there. my other issue was the lack of holistic care, knowledge of treatments outside the western medical tradition, and knowledge of the emerging health issuescontroversies that this new generation faces.this is why we switched to getzwell. i wanted a doctor that did a bit more then measure, vaccinate, listen to her heart and look in her ears. i have never felt so unrushed as i do at getzwell. i come in with a list of questions and she fields them all. she tells me about the latest findings on nutrition and whatever new information she is aware of.yes you do pay more. better care costs more. if you are on the fence i\'d say try her for a year. you won\'t burn through the college fund and then you can make a decision based on experience.imho this new generation of kids is growing up with health issues we never had to deal with. new diets, new toxins. meanwhile i don\'t believe the traditional training is keeping pace. my wife and i both agree that traditional western medicine has serious shortcoming. it\'s good to talk to a doctor who has more to offer then pills and hospitals.'),(2251,240,5,'this is a long overdue post. I posted one about this practice when we first started going  about two years ago!I cant say enough about Dr. G and Janice and the support staff. The waiting room and exams rooms are very clean and childfriendly. We have never had to wait past our appointment and we\'ve always been able to get a same day appointment, when needed.Dr. G is amazing with my daughter. The medicine practiced her is preventative rather than reactionary. Its true, that they dont accept accept insurance. However, as a result, the staff are not dicated by insurance company reimbursement rates and 10 minute appointments. We have a stack of our insurance reimbursement forms filled out and after a visit it takes two minutes to mail them in for reimbursement.'),(2252,240,5,'My 3 children have been patients of Dr. Getzelman\'s since the practice opened. We left one of the large popular pediatric groups over on California Street and I will never go back to that type of practice. When I call the office with a question, I get to speak to the doctor, not an advice nurse. When I email a question, a get a response from the doctor. When I arrive for our appointments, I do not wait more than 2 minutes and I never have to sit in the exam room with naked wriggly children! waiting for the dr. to finish with someone else. I never feel rushed and Dr. Getzelman asks so many questions that our last practice never asked about, but are actually very important to the health of my children for example, what type of support does our family have, what types of food do we eat, etc.My family\'s diet and over all health has improved dramatically over the past year and that is a direct result of the support and services at Getzwell.'),(2253,240,5,'I have been in the integrative healthcare field for over a decade now, working closely with some of the pioneers of functional medicine, renowned midwives, herbalists and bodyworkers. Before moving to SF, I did my homework on who was providing this type of care & spent a month interviewing providers. It is safe to say that GetzWell Pediatrics is the ONLY practice I felt totally aligned with. Care at GWP is individualized based on your family\'s dynamics, risk factors and lifestyle. I have total access to my provider & I am constantly engaged  as an equal  in the conversations around my family\'s health. The practice model allows for longer appointments, no wait time, more education about prevention, and a genuine intimacy of care which I really appreciate.Also, I think that their staff is great  extremely adept, compassionate and attentive. I look forward to a long relationship with GWP!'),(2254,240,5,'Dr. Getzelman is fantastic. Her approach is rooted in real knowledge, not anecdotal evidence or a gut feeling. I\'d say she relies on scientific research, but not in a sterile, rigid way. She is sensitive to the fact that every child and family are different, and above all, she is an attentive listener who responds to you, not some preconceived notion of what type of parent you may or may not be. Her practice is really smoothly run as we\'ve truly never had to wait. I\'ll just conclude by saying, we are very happy we found her!'),(2255,240,5,'This is an excellent pediatric practice. Julia is caring, wellinformed, flexible, and interested in finding out the right thing both for our baby and for the whole family. We appreciated her thoughtful and engaged approach to vaccination. We want our child vaccinated, but we\'re taking the schedule at a somewhat slower pace than normal. Julia has been helpful in setting up a schedule that works for us. She has helped us experiment with various minor health issues. She is wonderful with the baby. Her intelligence shines through in all her conversation with us. We are big fans of Janis Mandac, the pediatric nurse who works at Getzwell. She is tremendously knowledgeable and has a great attitude and approach. We bombard her with questions. She never rushes, and is full of good information and advice. One of the special things about Getzwell is that you can call and get either Julia or Janis on the phone fairly easily. You can also email, and they answer the emails quickly. We recently called about a skin problem our child had; it was Saturday and we expected a message referral to an advice nurse. Instead Julia picked up the phone and said to just bring the baby in so she could take a look. In fifteen minutes were there, parked in front, walked in the door, talked to the doctor for half an hour, and drove back home. This is not like any other medical office I\'ve been to.It is always calm and accessible. Because of our schedule we often have to change appointments, and they are always understanding. Really a special practice. We hesitated at first because they don\'t take insurance, but we have such a high deductible on our plan that it doesn\'t make that much of a difference. It seems like they are taking the time they would be spending on paperwork and giving to the patients, which I think is great. I\'d recommend this practice to anybody.'),(2256,240,5,'Executive Summary: Fantastic. Period. We\'ve been clients 2 kids  a 3 yo and 1 yo of Dr. Julia Getzelman we call her Dr. J and Getzwell Pediatrics for over 6 months, and we\'re THRILLED to be in her practice. This is in stark contrast to our previous pediatrician whose lack of diagnosis and aggressive treatment led to real negative consequences for our family. I began writing this Yelp months ago, and time has only reconfirmed and strengthened my early positive thoughts on the Getzwell practice. That said, what is a great fit for us may not be for you, so here\'re my criteria and descriptions so you can decide for yourself.It\'d be a good fit if you like:+Caring  trite and clichd as this sounds, you can see that she really cares deeply, whether that be about your kids or the parental interaction. She\'s totally sensitive to potential parental concerns, and is remarkably thoughtful and collaborative. +PersonableApproachable  she\'s one of the newer breed of doctors who acts like a person, with a great sense of humor, and a welcoming manner that invites the participation of the parents in the entire process of raising kids healthily.+Intelligent  again, should go wo saying, but she\'s wicked smart. This translates into a confidence when she deals with other smart people: she\'s a partner in helping parents raise healthy kids, and doesn\'t show any condescension just because she\'s so sharp. +UltraResponsive and Accessible  it\'s tremendous to know that when you\'d like to reach your pediatrician, you can. Her integration of technology makes it great especially for me, as someone who lives on email to be able to quickly touch base without having to navigate some phalanx of phone trees, web forms, or nightline operators.  *scheduling: just a breeze, as Johanna in reception is super friendly and helpful. We\'ve been able to get all our appointments really quickly either same day or next, based on the appropriate level of urgency and efficiently.  *email: She responds promptly and helpfully! to email! Remarkably, this in included for no additional charge. It\'s fantastic, and I\'m sure it creates a better level of care and experience for everyone, since it means that nobody has to wait until things have gotten so bad that it\'s worth going to the doctor. *afterhours coverage  When things were a bit touchandgo with our youngest, we could easily reach her, and she was proactive in checking in with us. A level of service truly above and beyond. *house calls if req\'d  During that same urgent period, she even made an offhours house call. Fantastic.+Current  Dr. Getzelman seems to be on the cutting edge of recent science and developments in the area of pediatrics, which is tremendously confidenceinspiring.+Scientific  We love that Getzwell is truly scientific and empirical in the treatment approach, and highly integrative in bringing in multiple disciplines and discussing options with us. The consultative approach works well for us, allowing the whole team to take an empirical journey together for our specific kids. +Holistic approach  wellness, not just unsickness. Very refreshing: the goal is a fuller, healthier childhood for the kids, not just avoiding sickness.It\'s *not* a good fit if you need:Unquestionable air of unapproachable pronouncements  If you want the greyhaired man with unquestionable authority issuing proclamations, you\'re in the wrong place. Dr. Welby has left the building. That said, our prior experience with an intentionally reassuring Dr. Welbytype was substantially less than stellar, and we much prefer the consultativepartnership approach.Automatic insurance billing. They don\'t bill your insurance for you, but they make it as easy as possible for you to do it e.g., you get superbills at each visit which you can submit to your insurer, and they accept credit cards which means you can get FF miles and finance the bills until the insurer reimburses you.Large staff of different doctors  I love the continuity of care that I get from a single doctor, but I know that some people like having a large staff to draw from. I\'ve read about Dr. Colleen Panina on the website, but she was on maternity leave her 3rd kid when we were sickest, and so I\'ve never met her personally. When I hear Dr. J detail her background and the glowing descriptions of her, I\'m glad that there\'s a worthy resource to back up Dr. J, and I\'m totally reassured in case we ever have to tap Dr. Panina\'s expertise and connections on hospitalization. We have also had good meetings with Leah the nutritionist a few times, and we including both my kids think that Janis, the nurse practitioner, is great despite the fact that she\'s usually the one administering the shots  that really says something!.Our conclusion:Our only hesitation in recommending the practice is that we\'re reluctant to share Dr. Getzelman and her colleagues with anyone else.'),(2257,240,5,'We could not be happier with our choice of pediatrician. Dr. Getzelman is thoughtful, thorough, patient, great with our son, and incredibly well informed about latest research and holistic health implications of medications and other choices. She is so easy to talk to, and she is even available by email. We have also had appointments with Emily, who is wonderful. We\'re finding this to be a truly excellent practice.'),(2258,240,2,'Hate to be the first non5 star review  but when it comes to finding a great pediatrician, I feel that it\'s best to be fully informed of all the pros and cons before you make this very important decision to entrust someone with the care of your child.Overall, love the location, the beautiful new, modern offices with uptodate equipment. Johanna the receptionist is very pleasant, friendly, and easy to communicate with. Janis is a wonderful nurse and my son loved her. I agree with the other reviewers that Dr. Getzelman is incredibly smart and knows her stuff great background and training but there were a few things that happened that made us switch practices:1 HIGH FEES:  We have a highdeductible HSA as Getzwell advises since she is out of network and doesn\'t accept medical insurance. I would pay more for superior care, especially since our son has had his share of more serious viruses and illnesses. But having to pay these very high fees both annual fees and per visit fee has gone *UP* in this recession in full at the end of each session and then have my insurance company cover very little of it were really driving up our medical costs. And yes, the doctor and nurse will spend more time with you as they say on their website, fewer patients, more time spent, but you definitely pay for it. When my son was irritable during a visit, we waited until he calmed down and they charged me an extra 30 minutes for this wait, even though it was just my son and I waiting in an empty room.2 BEDSIDE MANNER: I wouldn\'t say that Dr. Getzelman was cold but she wasn\'t exactly warm either, but some reason, my son absolutely hated her. I\'m not sure why. He loved Jancis and we\'d have 2 other pediatricians before we moved to SF and then switched hoping to get more attention from this practice and my son was comfortable with all of them. If I were to guess, I think that Dr. Getzelman seemed tentative around him, not particularly warm, and she didn\'t spend much time explaining what was happening next, which helps a child prepare. Once when my son had a respiratory virus and required inhaling from a nebulizer a small mask that blows mist, the doctor turned it on very suddenly and it was very LOUD and without warning, just shoved the mask onto my son\'s face and no surprise, he was SCREAMING and refused to do it again during that visit or at home for that matter. In contrast, when the nurse was trying to examine him, she made sure to explain everything and play with him first until he was comfortable. I was actually very shocked to see such roughness from a doctor who works with children, honestly. And when I was trying to comfort my son and give him more time by this time, he was freaking out, Dr. Getzelman was just laughing not sure if she thought it was funny or she was uncomfortable but it was strange, and immediately left the room and would only come back in after he\'d calmed down. She was armslength and didn\'t try to build rapport with him.3 MISMATCH OF PARENTING STYLE: Only recently did someone advise me to find a pediatrician who shared a similar parenting style. It makes a lot of sense to me now  even though I was focusing on medical expertise in the past. Pediatricians are asked to give advice on all sorts of developmental issues, which spills over into areas of discipline, etc. I don\'t think Dr. Getzelman has any children but when we asked the office to forward our medical files for a referral, I read my son\'s files and found that she had criticized my parenting style as weak and letting my child have complete control. And that she needs to talk to me about gaining control over my kid. That\'s fine  I agree that some people may not agree with my way of parenting but I don\'t agree with being a stern disciplinarian when your child is freaking out out of fear in a doctor\'s office. You can be stern when a child is trying to test your boundaries but when a child is crying heavily out of fear, I believe that having some empathy, focusing on soothing him and gently regaining his trust by explaining things thoroughly and letting him a little more control of the situation is more effective than pinning him down and just getting it done, especially with a toddler who doesn\'t know what the hell is going on. I strongly do not believe in the showing who\'s boss attitude that Dr. Getzelman seems to have. My son rarely throws tantrums but can be very fearful around needles, inhalers, all sorts of medical equipment as any toddler would! When he\'s that upset, I need to show some care and understanding, especially if I want to bring him back to the doctor\'s ever again! These criticisms about my parenting syle were the last straw for me  I couldn\'t justify paying so much more for a pediatrician who had this sort of approach with children while having my son endure such unpleasant visits to the doctor\'s office.'),(2259,241,5,'I was terrified when I found out I had two large fibroids that needed to be removed. I had been a patient at Kaiser but when my GYN there told me I was in a nowin situation choose surgery and maybe never be able to get pregnant, or don\'t choose surgery, get pregnant anyway and maybe lose the baby  to put it bluntly, as she did, I decided I needed a second opinion. I did a TON of research and almost got duped into UAE down in Los Angeles with a quack named Dr. Bruce McLucas. Turns out UAE can kill healthy tissue surrounding your myomas, which can in turn cause infertility or miscarriage. UAE also does not remove the myomas, it only shrinks them.I was so happy with Dr. Alison Jacoby. She met with me several times before performing my open abdominal myomectomy, she always made me feel like she had plenty of time for me and none of my questions were silly.I was in the hospital for two nights after the 4 hour procedure. Turns out I had 3 myomas, the largest of which was 15 cm. She successfully removed all three. I was able to get six weeks off of work for my recovery. I have started going to the gym and walking the dog a lot we got a new puppy after my six week recovery period. I was very happy with the care I got at UCSF. The anesthesiologist was wonderful, he gave me an extra shot of something when I was having preop anxiety. UCSF also has a good presurgery class you can attend. It was a little hippydippy for me but I ended up going home with the CD of affirmations and maybe it helped. The only thing I did not appreciate about UCSF  we had requested a private room and were put in a double  my husband and I had to make a stink about it and finally got our way. The charge nurse Blanca? was incredibly loud and brash  way too harsh for a postop patient who needs peace and quiet. And the food was terrible since they make it at a remote location and truck it in. The nurses were great.But I digress. Really this review is five gleaming stars for Dr. Jacoby  I would refer absolutely anyone to her, she is an angel on earth. She took out my staples herself, even though she was running late to give a lecture. Even the scar is well placed, well within my bikini line, symmetrical and fading fast. Also, Dr. Jacoby has given us the green light for future pregnancy.Excellent communication from her appointment coordinator Venice as well.Thank you Dr. Jacoby and team at UCSF!!'),(2260,241,3,'This is not a review for Alison, but the reception staff at UCSF Medical.Called to make an appt. and was told that Alison was not available for a month.The receptionist suggested I register with them first, and then she would be able to check the calendar to see if another physician was available.  After providing all of my information, insurance number, everything...she then says There is nothing available for a month.Ridiculous. She could have saved me the time and trouble by telling me that up front. I found I had to repeat myself alot...her listening skills were poor and she made assumptions about what I was making an appointment for, rather than listening to what was actually said.'),(2261,241,5,'Dr. Jacoby is amazing! She is so smart and ahead of her peers, and has amazing bedside manner. My original consult with her was so helpful  she answered all of my questions and explained everything so me and my husband could clearly understand. She was also the only surgeon to recommend the procedure that she did, which involved no extra incisions, because she was the only one skilled enough. She was so attentive and kind throughout the entire experience, checking in on me in recovery the next day and telling me to call her directly if I have any problems. She is truly top notch, and I would highly recommend her to anyone in need of surgery. Just the best!'),(2262,241,5,'I can\'t say enough good things about Dr. Jacoby. I had my surgery almost 2 years ago and it was the best decision made. She made sure I had all my questions answered and that after surgery an interpreter was there with her to explain everything to my family. The hospital staff was amazing. During my hospital stay they would also make sure my mom who is diabetic would have appropriate snacks and that she was comfortable spending the night. If you have any questions please feel free to send me a message.'),(2263,241,5,'Dr. Jacoby performed my myomectomy in July 2011and I\'m very happy that she did. I have an invisible scar from the operation and my recovery went smoothly. She\'s very caring, intelligent, and a top physician. There need to be more doctor\'s like her.'),(2264,241,5,'I feel a bit awkward writing a review for a physician seems inherently strange since it hits so close to home. Anyways, Dr Jacoby is a fantastic surgeon who specializes in leiomyomas fibroids. I found the yelp reviews super helpful, so if you have any specific questions about an open myomectomy please feel free to contact me directly.'),(2265,241,5,'I get many in box messages about Dr. Jacoby and having surgery...but sometimes I don\'t see that I have messages. So I thought it best just to post here what I send to patients that have had questions about my experience. First off, Dr. Jacoby is the Best and you can\'t go wrong with the Best. Second, the team at UCSF was exceptional from nursing to anesthesiology. I got excellent care.Now here are my tips if you are going ahead with the surgery.UCSF was great...nurses and anesthesiologists. They are a top notch operation.OK here are my tips...For the hospital bring:hand sanitizer  hospitals have sick people...you use it A LOT and all your visitorslip balmwax ear plugs  buy them at walgreens and then you split one in half and size it to your eareye patch coversAt night put ear plugs in and eye patch covers over your eyes. The nurses still come in and check on you but are more gentle, quieter and you can actually get some sleep. A small pillow  you put that on your tummy so if you have to cough, laugh, sit up you push into that and it helps A LOT!Coming home:It took me a full solid week to feel like myself. So, either have food prepared to go when you get home or call on friends and family to help and ask them to drop off dishes  My husband was super busy and so I sent out an email to my friends that when they came over to bring their favorite dish! Everyone wins. The surgery was so worth it...no more super duper heavy periods, no cramping or pains. I hate surgery but am so glad I did it. You are in excellent hands!Any other questions, and you can always reach me at andrea_wait@hotmail.com. Take care, Andrea'),(2266,241,5,'Dr. Alison Jacoby is beyond wonderful! I went to see her last year, March 2013, for a second opinion due to several large fibroids that had replaced my uterus. She was so easy to speak to. Even with delivering the bad news that I had no choice but to have a hysterectomy, she was compassionate and explained the surgery in layman terms. She eased my nerves. She performed a partial hysterectomy in April 2013. Her surgical skills are unique and amazing. She does not cut through the entire muscle wall, which aids in recovery. Rather, she spreads the abdominal muscles without cutting through them. Dr. Jacoby made the incision perfectly. It is low and not visible. That\'s great! It looks like a fine line and I even forget I have an incision because it so small. The entire surgical experience at Mount Zion was great from preop to being released. This was my first ever surgery so I was extremely nervous. The smaller facility is much more comfortable and personalized. I had a private room, which most rooms are so that makes a huge difference. The nurses and physicians were great with frequent check ins and caring attitude.  I had 2 followup appointments postop with Dr. Jacoby and she was always so caring and provided me with her medical expertise. She is awesome!UCSF is a high quality medical center and Dr. Jacoby is also the Director of their Fibroid Center. They are lucky to have Dr. Jacoby. She is extremely intelligent, a renowned expert in her field and very compassionate. I highly recommend her for any type of uterine surgery.'),(2267,241,5,'I have always wanted nothing more then to be a mom. I have a beautiful daughter and when fibroids were discovered I was told that it would be difficult to have another. I went from doctor to doctor until God led me the way to Dr. Jacoby. I saw her today and I cannot express in words how I feel. There is no guarantee what the myomectomy will bring, but at least the level of reassurance she has provided me will last with me. I am thankful to her for what she does, she is humble and sweet. If you have fibroids please try to see her, she is the best out there. Thankyou Dr. Jacoby!!!!'),(2268,241,5,'Dr Jacoby is one of the many OBGYN\'s who have cared for me at UCSF. I have a somewhat complicated medical history, and because each physician within the practice specializes in different areas, I go to the doctor that has the most expertise in a given area. That\'s something I really like about the OBGYN service at UCSF.Dr. Jacoby is friendly, reassuring, and an expert in the treatment of uterine fibroids. She answered all of my questions, and didn\'t make me feel small for asking them. On November 17, I had a Myomectomy to remove 12 uterine fibroids. I am in excellent shape right now and it has not yet been two weeks. The several months leading up to my surgery, I knew I was in the hands of a capable, competent, and compassionate surgeon. It was really important for me to feel a sense of peace about having such a major surgery, and Dr. Jacoby\'s calm, cool demeanor, coupled with her proven track record at UCSF, made me feel all the more reassured that I was in the very best hands. And I am.Another thing that stands out about her is that she knows the limits of her expertise and is not too arrogant to acknowledge it. For me, this is the mark of a consummate professional and highly competent physician. While I was pregnant last year, I had a very difficult time due to some preexisting health issues. I was seeing a different OBGYN with whom I was quite unhappy. So I asked to see another physician. I was given an appointment with Dr. Jacoby, who just happened to have an opening for when I next needed to be seen. When she learned of my specific issue, she leveled with me that high risk pregnancies and hypertension were not her areas of expertise, and that she did not feel comfortable treating me given this. However, she ended up referring me to Dr. Patricia Robertson, who specializes in highrisk pregnancies, in general, and hypertension in particular. She was a Godsend in her own right, but that\'s another Yelp review.I could not recommend Dr. Jacoby more highly, especially if you have fibroids. She is the best.'),(2269,241,5,'I just saw Dr. Alison Jacoby today. I thought she was great and very thorough. After reading some of the reviews, I was concerned and skeptical about how my experience would be.'),(2270,241,5,'Surgery is terrifying. Especially if you haven\'t gone through it before and don\'t know what to expect. Of course, mine wasn\'t for something lifethreatening I can\'t even imagine what that\'s like! but it helps knowing that your doctor is skilled, calm, and does that operation routinely. I consulted 3 doctors before I had surgery; Dr. Jacoby was the one who made me feel the most comfortable about going forward with the procedure.  She is at the top of a field most doctors only examine as an aside: uterine fibroids.  I only really felt pain in a few places on my incision; I don\'t know if that\'s impressive, but I was expected to be completely floored with the pain. And I wasn\'t. I\'m recovering well at my parents\' house and I credit her and her team with the ease of the experience.'),(2271,241,5,'I was sitting around a few days ago trying to remember why I created an account on Yelp.

Then it came to me, I wanted to send a personal message to someone that reviewed Dr. Jacoby.In most cases getting a chance to actually see an expert on your particular condition in person is pretty rare. This is someone who authored the journal articles, and piloted the studies that other doctors work from. I saw Dr. Jacoby\'s name mentioned in books, medical journals and on forums for years. I never considered trying to meet with her. About a year after one failed surgery I was feeling like I would never see the end. I didn\'t feel heard by my doctor at the time and none of the fixits they offered me were working. After a few internet searches I realized Dr. Jacoby wasn\'t too far from where I lived. I decided to set up an appointment with her and pay the fee out of pocket. I wanted real answers and I figured this was the only way I was going to get them. I was surprised with how personable she was. She heard everything I said, reviewed my medical history, processed it thoughtfully and gave me her opinion. She felt the temporary fixes that were in place were no longer working and that I needed to move forward with another surgery. She gave me a list of questions to ask and tests I should request from my home doctor before surgery. She knew my insurance wouldn\'t cover those costs if the tests were performed at UCSF. Once the tests were complete I could schedule my procedure with her at any time. The information Dr. Jacoby gave me allowed me to return to my home health care facility with conviction. I wanted to Dr. Jacoby to handle my procedure but the logistics at the time were to great to overcome. I was able to find doctors closer to home and within my HMO that were able to handle my case. But that visit lit the spark that lead to me getting my life back. I wanted to add my voice to the many women that are thankful Dr. Jacoby does what she does.'),(2272,241,1,'Dr. Jacoby seems to by professional BUT very ARROGANT and indifferent ...The time for waiting and meet her was 2 mounths and the appointement was resceduled last moment.....!In my opinion some doctors give you a favor to meet and speak with you...

I no longer spend three or four days a month in bed, immobilized with pain. I don\'t even have any visible scars!She scheduled my surgery on short notice, which I realize was just good luck on my part because usually she is booked for months in advance. During my initial consultation, she didn\'t make me feel dumb for asking questions. She came to visit me in the preop room, and after I woke up she called me in my hospital room to see how I was doing  she also apologized for forgetting to call my partner to let him know how the procedure had gone. I was up and around within a few days. Dr Jacoby called me at home a week afterwards to check in. I have heard lots of tales of surgeons who are arrogant, cold, impersonal, and never even talk to a patient after an initial consultation  not so with Dr Jacoby.

I probably put off the surgery longer than I should have, but I honestly didn\'t feel good about having it until I met Dr. Jacobyafter that, I could move forward with no fear. Dr. Jacoby was sympathetic to the pain I was experiencing as well as my need to have the procedure completed as quickly as possible so that I could travel overseas comfortably for business.  She did what she could to get me in for the procedure within only a few weekswhat a relief! The day of the surgery, Dr. Jacoby came to consult with me before the procedure and even came to visit with me while I was in recovery about 1 12 hours later. She showed me the photos of before and after which gave me a better understanding of what had been causing all my pain and symptomsand it was comforting to see how happy she was with the outcome of the procedure. Dr. Jacoby has great bedside mannerwarm and sympathetic while still conveying that she is an expert with respect to fibroids.

I was struggling with poorly controlled environmental allergies as well as frequent asthma problems. I was also being treated for ear infections on a regular basis with antibiotics, despite little indication of infection. My previous specialist had me try weekly allergy shots, for a number of allergens, to try to improve my symptoms. For a couple of months, it worked, but I began to have reactions to the shots which left me with head cold like symptoms at least 2 days every week. They repeated the same dosage week after week, and after at least 25 office appointments, hundreds of dollars in copays and many sick days, my symptoms were not improving and were not able to be controlled by antihistamines.Enter Dr. Emanuel into the equation... his first step was to validate my older allergy tests. He found a few foods that I ate regularly that I was mildly allergic to. Reducing these in my diet has helped reduce congestion. He also proposed using allergy drops instead of shots, and instead of trying to treat me for 45 allergens at once, just focused on my worst environmental allergy. I\'ve been using the drops for close to one year now. Not only do I tolerate the drops better I\'ve never had a reaction, it is cheaper and easier than allergy shots, since I don\'t have to go to the doctor each week. The drops have helped improve my allergy symptoms to the point that I rarely need to take allergy medicines. Dr. Emanuel also helped me pinpoint the times of year when my allergies would be the worst. Every fall since moving to San Francisco 14 years ago, I\'ve gotten really sick in September and October. I always blamed it on viruses spread when school starts again, but last year Dr. Emanuel warned me that dust mite allergens worsen this time of year. He offered me a steroid shot when my symptoms were at their worst, and this was the first fall I didn\'t spend weeks sick with respiratory problems!Other doctors have thrown antibiotics and steroids at my frequent ear and throat pain. Dr. Emanuel took stock of all of my symptoms and suggested I may have TMJ. He proceeded with treatment, and my symptoms improved for the first time in years.My asthma has been well controlled under Dr. Emanuel\'s care. Aside from a recent bout with the flu, I have rarely used my rescue inhaler, whereas I used to use it at least a few times per week.

He is honest and forthcoming about limitations of any treatment plan.I also like the office  no nonsense, no useless paperwork, very friendly and efficient NP and receptionist  they clearly have been working together for years. Whenever I call to set up an appointment, it takes less than a week before I see the doctor.You don\'t have to live uncomfortably, go see Dr. Emanuel.'),(2319,242,5,'This is a follow to an earlier review from a few years ago when I first started seeing Dr. Emanuel. I haven\'t had an actual sinus infection for over 2 years now. We did a procedure that was called Somnoplasty which wasn\'t surgery, but I had all sorts of needles in my nose for about an hour. Basically, no more chronic sinusitis! For that, 5 stars. Great staff, excellent care and very personable. He worked with me and created a plan for my specific needs. I recently recommended a friend and he\'s been very satisfied right off the bat.'),(2320,242,2,'The doctor is nice, but a lot of unnecessary costly procedures and I was just billed for his services an entire year and a half later! I was referred to Dr. Emanuel by a friend. We both experience digestive issues and through the Dr. she found out she was allergic to lots of different foods. I went to see him and was really optimistic because I know I\'m lactose intolerant, but I was having other weird stomach issues with food recently.He did a skin allergy test on me, but it didn\'t work cause I have sensitive skin. So they did a blood test and he gave me a food diary to keep for 2 weeks.I go back, give him my food diary and expect him to at least look it over and see what could be wrong  why I was burping, constipated, and bloated all the time. He didn\'t spend any time on the food diary at all so I don\'t know why I spent time writing down everything I ate and all the symptoms. And my blood results came back with no findings even though I know I\'m lactose intolerant or can\'t handle dairy that\'s proven!!Then he thinks I have acid reflux, so he says he wants to see how bad it is. He not only looks down my throat, but wants to look into my nose. He numbs my nose and takes a long rubber tube and sticks it up my nose going into the throat. It didn\'t hurt that much at the time, but after the numbing died down I had a massive headache. Then my insurance papers come and it turns out that the procedure was surgical. The cost was crazy!After multiple visits and odd procedures, I didn\'t learn anything new. And after all of that, I get a bill a year and a half later when I least expect it and have to seriously recall what the charges are for.'),(2321,242,5,'A couple of years ago i was very weak having some unresolve health problems  went to Dr. Emanuel. Found out I had some allergies issues...he is EXTREMELY thorough asking questions, giving you the tests. He spent time with me as a patient  gave me a food dairy to determine what was wrong...voila! He found out my food allergies and other allergies. Been going to him for about 3 years!if I have a issue  they squeeze me in  seems he has a LOYAL following. Staff is AWESOME Sandy and Rosina....even gave me coupons to save on my prescrptions.

I began a regimen of treatment which has me breathing well for the first time in years! He has been VERY thorough and also very kind. His sense of humor is a nice change from many doctors I have been to see him at the office only once but his very competent office staff has been in touch with me on the phone and has even mailed out my prescription so I didn\'t have to drive all the way to his office. I learned that Dr Emanuel is one of a dying breed of doctors that still make up their own vaccines. I cant offer any comment on the effectiveness of the vaccine yet but I am hopeful! He is the only doc and I have seen many to suggest that this may help.Five stars for sure and not simply because his treatments are working. He has been professional and is willing to think outside the box without being a Kook. He is really smart and never arrogant and that goes a LONG way with me.'),(2323,242,5,'I love Dr. Emanuel and even Rozina, his receptionist!. I\'ve been going to Dr. Emanuel for about 2 years now and I feel like he literally changed by life by curing my allergies. I had been suffering for SO long, years and years, and within my first couple of visit he deciphered exactly what it is I\'m allergic too, gave me some instructions, eye drops and a shot and I have been good to go. I go back whenever my allergies flare up and he gets me back in shape quickly. I also think he just a really nice guy. He seems to truly want to rid the world of allergies! I recommend him to everyone I know who has allergies.'),(2324,242,5,'You\'re allergic to crustaceans...I\'m going to write you a prescription for an epi pen so if you go into anaphylactic shock, stab yourself with it and then drive to the hospital.That was probably the worst thing that anyone has ever told me in my entire life.

Forbidden!* Gorgeously butterflied tiger shrimp, panseared on a sprig of rosemary. Jailbait!Of course once you arrive at Dr. Emanuel\'s office, you realize that your little food allergy is quaint when compared with the kind of heavyduty allergies that this man treats. Maybe its his soothing South African accent, maybe because his exam rooms all have medical technology that were manufactured circa 1940, or maybe because he has Dr. Seuss in the waiting room, he is a great doctor to help you out with your demotivating ailments.'),(2325,242,4,'I\'ve seen Dr Emanuel for over 2 years, almost once a month. i have a rare ear condition and his job was to clean the wax out, which he has done with candor, good spirit, and hopefully good judgement.The office staff are wonderful. The receptionist has had no problem with my constant chopping and changing, and she has never said anything even mildly offensive. She\'s great. The nurse or PA I\'m not sure is also very nice and I think she works well with Dr Emanuel.Dr Emanuel also treated me for allergies and put me out of my misery with an injection. It was that simple. I only wish i had seen him earlier. Overall, very highly recommended.'),(2326,242,5,'Dr. Emanuel cured my hearing problems today.

I like the fact that he is willing to use brute force methods to deal with serious reactions, but will follow up with more gentle and long term solutions to help get you beyond the allergies.

Just be prepared that he\'s direct and efficient.'),(2328,242,4,'I saw Doctor Emanuel for a required, preaudiology screening medical exam. I felt that Doctor Emanuel was direct, appropriately interested and thorough. He didn\'t stop after just the ear exam, he went on to ask me about other aspects of my health so i felt like i got to talk about everything that I wanted to talk about before I left the office. He also made it a point to explain my right of return for audiology products I purchase and arranged a post audiology screening consultation.

Allergies suck!!!'),(2330,242,1,'I went to Dr. Emanuel a couple weeks ago for a clogged ear. I have a regular ear doctor but since moving from the area I hadn\'t found one local in San Francisco yet. I couldn\'t hear out of one ear so I decided I needed someone local and immediate and Dr. Emanuel\'s office was able to get me in the same day. I was optimistic about the visit since he had great reviews but unfortunately my experience was quite the opposite. He didn\'t ask about my long history with ear infections and tubes. I did tell him that I had one in my right ear that I hadn\'t grown out of yet and was hoping had fallen out since they hadn\'t been checked on in a while. He told me that the clogged ear was just wax build up and that the tube was no longer there. Now if anyone has ever had tubes, you understand the relief of not having them anymore because of all the care and caution you need to take when you DO have them. He didn\'t seem very thorough in my visit so I came to see my regular doctor while visiting family. Right away he says your tube is clogged meaning it STILL WAS THERE. Dr. Emanuel seemed very rushed during my visit and was very short answered in answering my questions. I felt I needed to write this review because after finding out that Dr. Emanuel gave me wrong information and something in my exam was missed, it was important to share.'),(2331,243,5,'Had a injury at my restaurant job when I slipped and a wine glass cut deep into my palm. I was referred to Dr. Miranda by the emergency room doctor who said he was one of he best hand surgeons in the area and I agree, on several levels! When I went in nervously for the preop appointment he was personable, direct, and didn\'t act irritated when I asked a lot of questions like other doctors tend to do. It was a great surgery and I received good follow up care as well. His PA Kelly is also wonderful, very friendly, businesslike, and it\'s clear that she knows what she\'s doing. His other is PA was less confidenceinducing: spent a lot of time on smalltalk, answered my questions vaguely, and sometimes left me wondering if he\'d read my chart at all. My hand healed up quite well. Dr. Miranda and his office were also great at helping me understand and acting as liaisons between me and the workers\' comp insurance company  who you can imagine are not the friendliest of folks, even though my injury was a pretty black and white situation. Unfortunately several months after my initial surgery another issue developed in my hand that took some time to figure out. The office worked with me to try a number of different solutions before it became clear that another surgery was the best option. It was difficult to determine if this issue was workers\' comp related or not, which made me nervous because Dr. Miranda was not in my network for my regular insurance. After surgery, it turned out that the issue was not related to my work injury and my other insurance company was only going to pay outofnetwork rates. After all of the wonderful care and communication, Dr. Miranda\'s office even worked with me to negotiate alternate rates so I\'m not paying a massive amount of doctor\'s bills for the next decade of my life. As a waitress in graduate school and now a public school teacher, I can\'t express how much I appreciate such a compassionate and generous gesture. I would recommend Dr. Miranda to anyone needing orthopedic help even if it feels a little offputting to walk into a very swanky plastic surgery office. His front office staff is also great, and Chris who runs his billing was also very friendly, available and willing to help me navigate workers\' comp information. One note, be sure to ask who you\'ll be having an appointment with when you make it, sometimes it is just one of his PAs and you might need more information from the doctor, especially if you\'ve got an insurance company to deal with.'),(2332,243,1,'Back in May 2014, after an ATV accident that left my nose and my cheek bone broken, I was referred to Dr. Eduard P. Miranda at 77 Van Ness Ave #302, San Francisco, CA. When I called to set up an appointment I asked if they accepted Anthem Blue Cross and they said they did. Once, I arrived to their office the front desk clerk told me that I needed to pay $300 hundred dollars and that I could bill my insurance Anthem Blue Cross for reimbursement. They falsely claimed to take my insurance as I found out later, Dr. Miranda was not a Anthem Blue Cross provider.I ended up paying the $300 out of pocket and my consultation was no longer than 15 minutes. He asked me to leave my CT Scans with him. Two days later his assistant email me, saying that  I needed surgery immediately and to send a deposit of $10,000 to begin the procedure which was going to cost around $40,000. Over the next week, I went to see 4 different doctors to get different opinions on how my healing process was going and if I needed surgery. All of the other doctors said I was healing well and rapidly. I was relieved to hear from each of the other four doctors that no surgery was needed. I called Dr. Miranda to inform him I did not want the surgery and would not be needing his services.It has been over a year now since my accident and I have healed well. In May 2015, I received a notice from collections for over $758 dollars, billing me for my CT Scan that Dr. Miranda sent to be reviewed by a Radiologist at CPMC  Davies Campus without my consent. All the other doctors I saw were able to read and identify the CT Scan in front of me. Dr. Miranda released my personal information and medical records without my knowledge or my consent to do so.At the moment, I am in collections for the unprofessionalism of Dr. Miranda. He took the time to email me asking for the $10,000 dollars deposit, but he did not take the time to email me asking for my permission to show my CT Scan to a Radiologist for which I was going to be billed for it.I have tried to reach Dr. Miranda and the CPMCDavies Campus, but they have told me that there is nothing they can do. i have to pay for a service I did not consent for and didn\'t know would be done.

However Dr. Edward Miranda and his team has made my entire experience very pleasant to say the least. From initial consultation to post ops care, Dr. Miranda and his team were responsive and prompt. They went above and beyond to make sure dealings with insurance company were through, even though my insurance did not cover my procedure. Dr. Miranda is not only the kind of doctor that pays attention to his patients\' needs but he also is an extremely skilled surgeon.  All my life, due to my genetics, I\'ve always been slow to recover from injuries and physical traumas and extremely sensitive to pain. Therefore, initially I was concerned about the length of time it\'ll take for me to recover.  I recovered very quickly and with almost no pain there were soreness and discomfort post op, which was expected and the result was wonderful.

Let\'s get the straightforward and obvious thing outoftheway: this man is incredibly talented. But more than that, while obviously quite busy, when you\'re sitting with him and talking, you never feel rushed. And the job he did was amazing.

Again, no explanation, no apology, Zip.'),(2336,243,2,'Dr. Miranda is great. He is warm, open and seemed very confident.However, his insurance policy is outrageous. I think it\'s unethical to serve and an oncall MD for an ER and only accept two forms of health insurance. His admin told me he accepts Medicare and Tricare.The full story:Dr. Miranda saw me after I fell off my bicycle to check whether I had fractured my orbit bones around my eye.The ER referred me to Dr. Miranda who was the oncall plastic surgeon and I was dumb enough not to ask whether he was in my network. CPMC as a hospital accepts my insurance, an I have never come across an MD in SF who does not accept my blue shield PPO. I was in his office when his admin told me it would be out of network with a $300 payment required upfront. So I walked in with openeyes about what the costs would be, but I felt I had no other option. It was already late afternoon and I doubted I\'d be able to find another MD to see me at that point. So I made a judgement call that it was worth it to me to pay.The moral of this story is doctors who accept very few forms of insurance should not serve as the oncall MD for an ER. It always catches patients off guard as you can see from numerous similar reviews.'),(2337,243,5,'One word to describe my experience from start to finish with Dr. Miranda and his office: AMAZING. Before I came to Dr. Miranda, i went to a few consultations for breast augmentation and no other doctor made me feel as comfortable or confident with my decision. He was very honest when it came to size and what he thought would look best and most natural for my body. I am very thankful for that because I almost went bigger which wouldn\'t have looked proportioned to the rest of my body. Prepping for my surgery was a breeze. Dr. Miranda has an amazing yes amazing surgical cordinator, Tori, who makes herself avaiable almost 247. She basically did all the work for me when it came to getting my preop results from Kiaser, who is extremely difficult to get anything from. She made me feel like I was in really good hands the whole time. I was very nervous the day of the surgery and the staff at the surgery center were also, amazing. The results of my augmentation, also amazing. I told Dr. Miranda I wanted the most natural looking job, I even showed tori pictures and they came out exactly how I wanted. Dr. Miranda is a magic worker, post operatively, I was in hardly any pain. And when was expericing some discomfort over the weekend, Tori was extremely responsive to text messages and called something in the pharmacy for me. They even sent me flowers the day after the surgey! I got the gummy silicone at 330cc, and they look completely natural, hardly any scarring or postsurgial discomfort. I would suggest him to anyone looking to have their breast done. Sidenote: I work for an orthopedic surgical office and honestly we can learn something from the way Tori treats and handle their patients. I was extremely impressed. Thank you so much Tori!!Additional side note: I noticed anyone giving this office bad reviews is because of insurance or billing issues. Patients really need to learn to be more self efficient and own up to their responsibility. That is what the online Portols are for and customer Service is for. Doctors are supposed to treat, patients should do their part and know who take their insurance. It shouldn\'t always be placed on the staffs\' responsibility, of course they will help as much as they can but there are are million different type of insurance plans and can take hours sometimes being on hold with insurances while the staff need to be taking care of actual patients. Just Please keep that in mind when it comes to writing and reading reviews.'),(2338,243,5,'Last summer I scheduled a consultation with Dr Miranda through Tori as a referral.

My story may be atypical because I am not a plastic surgery patient. I was referred over by a local hospital after breaking my wrist hairline fracture at the waist of my scaphoid.I hope that anyone in a similar situation to me takes precautions when dealing with this doctor. I ended up finding a new doctor that was much better.Pros:+Very friendly office staff and very easy to make an appointment. The doctor\'s schedule fit very well with my busy professional life.+Clean office. I was impressed by how his office looks. It is very modern+Close to my house in Hayes Valley so I could walk to his office during visitsCons:Billing practices were unethical: They did not make it clear they were not a preferred provider for my insurance provided by my employer. I asked if they took my insurance when I booked my appointment over the phone. They said yes, but never mentioned they weren\'t a preferred provider on the phone.After I signed my paperwork and sent over insurance, they did briefly mention in an email that they were not a preferred provider. However, I had never been to the doctor before on my own insurance and because of my naivety, this was very easy for me to overlook. After my first visit, when I asked the front desk how much I owed them they said we\'ll send you the bill. They booked me for another follow up appointment.I went to the second appointment to get a full cast on. Afterwards I asked how much I owed and they told me to look for the bill in the mail. They booked me for another follow up appointment.I had to go back a few days later because the cast was put on too tight and the doctor had to remove it and put on another.A few days later I got the bill. It turned out that each 30 minute visit was being billed between $700$1200 per visit. It turns out they had never billed my insurance.I had my mom help me to deal with the billing issues and we were able to have the insurance cover the cost. I received many threats of being sent to a collection agency while the issues were being resolved.Doctor did not seem to listenI would tell him that my cast was too tight but he seemed rushed. I ended up having to get the cast removed. I believe that if he had listened to me more and slowed down that I could have avoided all that pain. Then again, maybe not, but when I tell my friends about this, they find it unusual that I had to go back so many times.Doctor does not specialize in orthopedicsHe seems to do a lot of plastic surgery but I believe that because of his lack of specialization in orthopedics, he was not prepared. He only ever had one type of cast color on hand, and I was told by later doctors that his cast work was poor.Also, there was no xray in the building. I was getting sent to drive to an xray clinic. Another orthopedic doctor had an xray in his office and it made a huge difference in my schedule not having to do two appointments in a week.Summary: I\'m glad that this happened to me in a way, because it made me learn to read yelp reviews. It seems many nonplastic surgery patients had a similar experience with doctor Miranda. This experience also helped me to learn what a preferred provider was. It also made me really appreciate my next doctor that I read about on yelp and his knowledge and care about my broken bone. I also learned that I do need to ask the tough questions and not assume that everything is ok and working out in my favor.I wrote this review to help similar people like me but I do not mean to talk bad about Dr. Miranda\'s skill as a doctor, this is just my experience with him and his business. It was a very negative experience and caused me months of anxiousness and pain that I now know how to avoid in the future.'),(2345,243,5,'I\'m just amazed at how this one person, Dr. Miranda can make such a difference in so many people\'s lives.

I had a great excellent experience here and will continue to come back for any cosmetic procedures. I was able to get in for an appointment right away. I have had issues with previous doctors\' offices never having open appointments that fit with my busy schedule. The staff at Dr. Miranda\'s office goes above and beyond all expectations.  My first visit was very comfortable from the moment I walked into the office. The front office staff helped me ease my initial anxiety I tend to get when going to new doctors. I received botox from Dr. Miranda in my forehead. I had never had this done before and wanted to do something special for myself on my birthday.  Dr. Miranda listened to all concerns that I had, obviously I was nervous that it would look fake or unnatural but that was not the case. I am defiantly hooked. Dr. Miranda did just the right amount and I was extremely happy with the results.My results took a few days to show up but it has continually progressed over the past week. I did not have any brushing and was not sore. There was almost no pain during the injections although I did have the numbing cream prior to injections. This was an overall great experience and I can\'t wait to go back again in four months!'),(2352,243,5,'I saw Doctor Miranda for a surgery about a month ago from a referral from a couple of people actually which gave me a confidence....it\'s very intense for me to trust anyone with this kind of procedure. First of all I found the office and a personnel to be extremely professional, sweet and attentive. Doctor Miranda himself really went out of his way to work with me, and was very caring and patient which really put me at ease. One of the things that I really liked about him was his attentiveness and acute attention to detail...After my surgery was done I was very satisfied as this was not an easy task to perform...I believe that Doctor Miranda is a very skilled and a talented professional who can truly makes a difference. I would recommend his work to anyone.Thank you Doctor Miranda...you are awesome !!'),(2353,243,5,'I haven\'t yelped in a LONG time because I\'ve been super busy but I must write a review for Dr. Miranda due to the results I\'ve seen and how happy I am with the entire experience. I started to grind my teeth couple of years ago and noticed my jaw muscles getting bigger. And, reflecting on it now it was definitely due to stress. I\'ve talked to many professional who did Botox but they weren\'t familiar with the jaw muscles. I was recommended to Dr. Miranda by couple of people and he was highly recommended, which was very comforting to me because I was scared of getting this done. At my consultation Dr. Miranda spent quite a long time explaining the procedure and answered all my questions and concerns I had. His professionalism made me feel at ease and gave me the courage to make my appointment. I have been to Dr. Miranda\'s office several times now and I can tell you he hires the most considerate and skilled professionals I\'ve encountered at any doctor\'s office. I actually look forward to calling for my appointment and seeing Dr. Miranda because they know me by name and make me feel so comfortable. I can\'t express how grateful I am to have found Dr. Miranda. If you\'re having doubts or questions about a procedure I would highly recommend at least getting a consultation with him. Dr. Miranda can change your life. ='),(2354,243,5,'I would give Dr. Miranda 10 STARS if Yelp allowed it! I never would have thought that I would need Botox ever! But as I grew older my forehead started to wrinkle more and I had crow\'s feet around my eyes that became more and more visible. To be honest I was nervous because of all the horror stories that you hear about getting Botox and you never know if it would happen to you. Well Dr. Miranda has this ability to ease your mind with his knowledge and background; he answered all my questions and concerns and was very easy to talk to. So we started the Botox procedure. I thought it was going to be painful since needles are involved, but it turns out that there was barley any pain. I was so surprised on how effortless and easy that was! Dr. Miranda is amazing! I loved the way the Botox worked and no one even knew that I had it done! I\'ve been referring friends to him ever since.  I definitely would recommend him to everyone because he sincerely cares and listens to your needs and wants. I haven\'t seen him in a while since I got pregnant and had a son, but now that I\'m no longer breastfeeding I will be going back real soon! I want to thank Dr. Miranda and his staff for making me feel comfortable and beautiful every time I\'ve visited. I miss you guys and I\'ll be coming back real soon!!ALSO, YOU HAVE TO GET THE RAVISH PRODUCTS!! THEY ARE AMAZING!! I LOVE THE CLEANSERS AND THE TONER!!'),(2355,243,1,'I hope that whoever reads this review, whether it be Dr. Miranda\'s staff or potential new patients, knows that I\'m not a bitter or vindictive person. I just want to let other potential patients know to do your research. And in reading the previous reviews regarding this doctor, it seems like this seems to be a recurring problem for his practice. My son was admitted to CPMC in June of this year with the flesh eating bacteria in his right knee. He was in the hospital for over 2 weeks. Needless to say, it was an excruciating experience as a parent and for my son. Dr. Miranda was the oncall doctor at CPMC and he was called on to my son\'s case as a specialist in the field of this type of infection. By the way, we did not request for a specialist  though we\'re of course grateful.After my son was released from the hospital, we found out that Dr. Miranda is not paneled with the our insurance carrier. We have Healthy Family Insurance, basically lowcost insurance for lowincome families. The HF insurance covered ALL bills charged for my son\'s care, Dr. Miranda needed to be paneled in order to be paid through our provider. He or his office staff stated that they refused to be paneled and that we, the family, would be responsible for a $11k+ bill. Countless calls and urging from the staff at California Children\'s Services a division of HF without any result. They basically told the CCS agents that we were responsible for the bill. Note that there were other doctors that got paneled so that they could be paid without any problems. It just seems to me he\'s out for the bottom line and there\'s no concern as to how he gets his payment. Ultimately, the bill was sent to a collection agency for payment  without my knowledge. I just get a very rude call from a collection agency saying that we needed to pay. We have HF insurance for a reason, we are a lowincome family and pay a low premium amount for insurance coverage for our 2 children. It\'s not like we\'re trying to get a handout. I spoke with Chris in billing at Miranda\'s office and she said it\'s not personal, it\'s a business. I beg to differ, it\'s not just a business, it\'s people\'s lives you\'re dealing with. Who is ever prepared for your child have a life threatening infection and not say please do whatever it takes to save our child??!! Who is then prepared for an outrageous bill sent to them eventhough they can\'t afford it. It just seems unreasonable to me that Miranda wouldn\'t get paneled to be paid, but rather send the bill to collection to a family that obviously can\'t afford to pay a $11K+ bill. Of course he has the right to not get paneled, it\'s how he runs his office. It\'s a business afterall. I accept that. But as a human being, wouldn\'t you try to work something out with the family to see howif payments can be made. Even reducing the bill, would have been a reasonable request. If you\'re NOT going to accept ALL forms of insurance in your practice, why the heck wouldn\'t you just stay a private plastic surgeon physician and not be an oncall physician at a children\'s hospital??!! A children\'s hospital, where you have to know that there would be families there that may or may not be able to fork out outofpocket cash for experience and knowledge that you are graced with. So in conclusion, after months of back and forth with CCS, Miranda\'s office and collections, we were lucky enough to get someone to help us pay for a negotiated final payment of the bill of $3K. Seems to me that the State would\'ve paid him more if he got paneled, but that\'s how it is I guess.Good luck with your business, sir. May you save countless more lives. But I hope that you\'ll open your business to more people that may need you.'),(2356,243,5,'Dr. Miranda is wonderful  have a lot of friends that Dr. Miranda has helped both in the hospital and his office  including personal advise I\'ve used with my doctor. He\'s helpful with elective surgery, and also advises not to to procedures. Just wanted to publicly thank Dr. Miranda and his staff for kindly going out of the way to help personal friends and family. He\'s confident, kind, generous, fully listens to the issues  and contributes to everyone he has contact with.

Then, as we were facing followup care and complication with the surgery, we discovered that although Dr. Miranda was the oncall doctor at the ER, he was indeed out of network of our insurance company, and we were told that in order for our child to see Dr. Miranda again, we would have pay out of pocket.We contacted Dr. Miranda\'s office several times and even emailed pics of our child\'s laceration in order to find out the seriousness of complication; however, we never received any response nor call from Dr. Miranda and were merely told that he would not be able to give us any information until we came into his office.Furthermore, we received a bill for the procedure he\'d performed as part of the ER care, majority of which was identified as anesthetics.

I wanted a natural look and not a deer in the headlights, and that\'s exactly what he gave me. I definitely recommend him to anyone for everything because I have seen his work and it\'s superb. I was super nervous before getting the botox but He explained everything to me before I got the treatment which helped me to relax. Thanks Dr. Miranda !'),(2359,243,5,'Hello, I am a UC Berkeley student and I shadowed Dr. Miranda for a number of his surgeries in the past year. I hope to offer a bit of a student\'s perspective on Dr. Miranda\'s office, staff, and his work.His surgery clinic just opened in the last year and a half, and it is the most modernlooking office I know of. The Yelp pictures should give an idea of what I mean. It is fantastically well built and advances patient care at all levels. The waiting room is large and stocked with a good number of magazines. I found myself enjoying a bit of the 50 Most Innovative Companies of 2013 Nike is #1! in a magazine and the Rolling Stone\'s review of Daft Punk\'s new album, Random Access Memories. The preop room is warm, welcoming, and staffed by one of the nicest nurses I know Yessie was her name. The two operation rooms fancy a pair of the coolest looking doctorviewinglamps for lack of better words; check out the Yelp pictures. All the equipment looks new and wellmaintained.Dr. Miranda\'s staff is also very friendly. I spoke abundantly with the main patient coordinator, Elaine, and she is absolutely the best. You can tell she really cares about providing the best patient experience. The other doctors and nurses that work with Dr. Miranda have a great relationship with him. Some of the doctors are people that have worked with Dr. Miranda during his medical school and residency years.From my experience, I can say that Dr. Miranda is a fantastic teacher and a teamplayer in the operation room. He works well with his physician assistant, Kelly, as well as with the circulating and scrub nurses. There is usually a bit of casual radio in the background while Dr. Miranda works with his PA on the surgery. Overall, the working environment is relaxed and friendly, but remains very professional. Just from asking Dr. Miranda questions, I\'ve gotten to learn tons about surgery, anatomy, and medical school from his huge knowledge bank. He knows his surgery very well and needless to say, is a professional at what he does. He provides the best patient care possible and remains a caring human being at heart. I highly recommend Dr. Miranda for his expertise and care.'),(2360,243,5,'Upon my visit to Pacific Plastic Surgery Group, I was initially nervous and didn\'t know what to expect as this was my first time at this type of doctor\'s office. From the moment I walked in however, I was put at ease by the decor and vibe of the office. It was decorated beautifully and in such a way, I think, to put patients in a brighter mood. I was in for a minor insurance procedure but the front desk staff treated me as if I was one of their regular clients with the utmost courtesy and first class service. I was consulted and treated by Dr. Miranda, and he was very professional and made me feel very comfortable. I was in and out of there in a very timely manner.

He promised to work with us on the billing and his response was no response and threatening us with collection. I was confused and couldn\'t believe his lack of personal care for my wife\'s issues. This is an over the top office with no help or care for the patient. Miranda had constantly said we wouldn\'t have to worry about the costs and then the result was a threat to our credit rating.

Found out afterwards that he was an out of network doctor How did this happen and why was I not told this when I asked at CPMC that this would be covered?, and after several rounds with insurance was denied coverage.DOUBLE insult that Dr. Miranda\'s bill had multiple double charges, and grossly over inflated charges for a 30 minute procedure bill was over $5,000 which was then sent to collections while I was still in process with insurance and state of CA. Blue Shield list price is $1500 for the same procedure.Ended up paying to collections as Dr. Miranda\'s office would not help on any fronts other than to punt me back to my insurance carrier which they did not recognize or belong to.

I did have some dogearing but Dr. Miranda took care of it with a revision procedure in office yesterday.  His PA, Kelly, is awesome! Between the two of them, I knew I was in the best care possible. I was awake during the procedure and they were ever so professional and courteous in and making sure my pain was managed. When I experienced some bleeding today, I called the office and Dr. Miranda called me back right away and instructed me on how to care for it and followed up 15 minutes later to make sure the bleeding had subsided.  I was trying to be superwoman and get some housework done and not resting like I should have. Dr. Miranda\'s calm and patient bedside manner put me at ease and he was ready to see me right away if I felt I needed to come in. Luckily, his instructions worked and I didn\'t have to go back in.

He offered to resubmit all of the paperwork to the insurance company to help with the bill. I understand that Dr.s need to focus on being a doctor and trust the people around them to do everything else, sometimes it just doesn\'t work out that way.

I feel the Dr. Miranda provides a more personalized, professional service and care rather than the cattle herd you may find at many other medical practices. He was very professional and made me feel comfortable at a time when I think most people wouldn\'t be. He was conscientious about ensuring I was feeling no pain during the procedure and was thorough with providing patient education and so forth. I was healed from the procedure within 57 days with very little discomfort. Dr Miranda called me personally to make sure I was doing okay and to inquire about the condition of my wound.

Then he took a complete history and gave me a lot of hope  that what WE were going to do would work. He has me doing contrast baths, using a TENS unit, taking medication, and using a compound cream as well as really good runningwalking shoes.

He won\'t give you and xray or MRI unless it\'s absolutely necessary. I\'m a fan of his approach as well as his bedside manner.

Dr. Salk assesses the severity of your problem and makes sure that you understand any nonsurgical treatment options that might work to alleviate your pain. He strongly recommends you try these less intensive options prior to suggesting surgery and that is rare to find these days.

The office is shared by a group of physicians with varying specialtiesincluding varying office staff behind the counter at the California street office.

Meeting Dr Salk seemed to slowly  melt the ice felt in the front office. He was personable, informative, and took the time to answer questions, offering alternatives and possible ways to treat particular issues with me.In 40 years of being a professional, I am saddened that some of the best physicians can have staff behind the desk, and not know how they represent the office. The initial impression of the culture of that office may be undermined by these individuals i.e. How do my patients, new or established, feel about how our office staff interacts with them?This may be a nonissue once the patients are established, but do the doctors know how many self, or worse yet, physician colleague referrals walk away because they don\'t want the hassles? Physicians, historically, don\'t know much about, and don\'t want to really be involved on these daytoday issues. A good office manager who has behavioral expectations can make a difference. And doctors, please notice how your office staff interact with your patients!! Remember, other than for annual exams, patients see a doctor when something is not right.

He was patient, explained how these options might help and, if need be, what surgery would entail.

He either gets 5 stars or 1 star probably zero star if there was such a selection and just very few in betweens. I had two appointments: The first appointment was a good experience in 2012. I went there seeking consultation for a bump on top of my right foot and discolored toenails on both feet. His advice was: 1 leave the bump which is a Ganglion cyst and come back when it\'s a lot bigger, and would drain it or remove it; 2 as for the nails, it is fungus, he could give oral medication after liver test or laser nail treatment. Since neither issue really needed immediate attention, I decided to wait  1st visit=$270. The second appointment was the following year in 2013, not good experience at all. I had met my deductible, so thought it was a perfect time to care for the Ganglion cyst. This time, Dr. Salk was the evil Mr. Hyde. I felt he was short with me, totally in a hurry... and gave me quite a scare, said the cyst was right underneath the artery to my heart and that it\'s very risky; and that he doesn\'t like to do the surgery, BUT if i wanted him to, he can TRY. He never said this on the first visit, then he got up and flipped my chart close signaling a visit end and for me to make up your mind. I slipped off the exam chair, and told him, no thanks. I was so upset, I walked out of there with my head down... on the drive home, I thought, I probably should have given him a piece of my mind, but didn\'t.

They demanded payment for a measly 53 dollars on a bill that wasn\'t even past due. I explained that I\'d like to sort through my bill before I pay it, but that wasn\'t an option. They denied my visit that day to see the doctor for my preop, even though I had a surgery date scheduled with him a week later. Dr. Salk never called to follow up as to why I didn\'t show up for preop. Inconsiderate doctor and even worst support staff.

He operated on her and implanted a plate and several screws to hold the bone together. She was casted for many weeks and then had to use a boot until she was fully healed. It was a harrowing experience. Dr. Salk was sensitive and thorough and always spent lots of time with both of us to try to assure us that all would be okay. Some years later she developed a cyst and had to have surgery to remove the hardware. Again it was a lengthy healing process that was emotionally difficult for a 17 year old girl. Again, through it all, Dr. Salk was sensitive, accessible and encouraging. Prior to the surgery he explored alternative treatments with us. However, it became clear that surgery was necessary. Hopefully, I will never need Dr. Salk again as a treater.

I was notified of the fee way over $100 that\'s for sure and was told it had to be paid in full, before I could arrange pick up I had an injury to my leg after the casting so couldn\'t really go grab them up! so after trying many times to contact someone in billing I was being billed late fees and wasn\'t paying them till they took them off, which the billing dept. agreed to do! I kind of gave up. Since I got the orthotics which hurt and are horribly painful, so much so I have never worn them for more than 24hrs in TOTAL!

Two weeks goes by, I go in for a 90 second check up that is over before I even get my sock off not kidding!!, tell Dr. Salk my foot feels the same after following all his instructions, and his response is, yea...it will take the tincture of time.

He has a great demeanor and is an all around nice guy which makes him a fantastic doctor. If that wasn\'t enough, he recommended a revolutionary treatment to me about a year ago that has changed my life. For almost two decades I have been suffering from osteoarthritis in my right ankle thanks to a stupid sledding accident when I was 14. I have had two major surgeries and thought pain, swelling, and antiinflammatory pills would be a way of life forever. In a casual discussion about this, Dr. Salk recommended Hyalgan injections google it usually given in the knee but, thanks to his findings in a clinical trial, prove to be about 7080% effective in the ankle too. I waited to load up my Health FSA account and then started the series of 3 injections in June. Luckily, I was a success case and have enjoyed a pain free ankle ever since.

This, of course, is how it ought to be but we\'ve all experienced the truer standard of less than ideal...Dr Salk is passionate about his practice, scholarly, and eager to unravel the mysteries of your feet, with you.

Unlike most frenzied primarycare docs, she acts like she has all the time in the world to discuss issues and provide sensible advice.

When I arrived 5 minutes late yesterday for an annual exam, I was denied service due to a no tardy no service policy implemented by David Buchholz, MD and Medical Executive Director of this facility. If you are one minute late, they will not honor your appointment. Moreover, when this happened, it was 9:18 AM and one patient in the waiting area. It\'s not like they were packed. Both receptionists insisted they understood, and were sorry, but unfortunately that was their policy. No exceptions. Though this has been reported to five different sources within UCSF, I\'m not done yet.

Yet, the overt lack of interest or care for the circumstances surrounding the issue combined with his growing odor of arrogance and selfimportance made for an extremely impersonal visit. The office: I had to provide insurance information 3 different times. Then I was never invoiced for a bill. Instead I received emails asking me to log into a portal to access the bill.

Dr. MacGregor came in and did a good job analyzing my skin and giving me one and only one recommendation for my skin. I feel as though there should always be options even if it is a long term care. I just wanted a few options or maybe even a temporary alternative to my problem. He seemed a bit bored and despondent towards my questions and concerns. I kept asking questions in search of something a little more than a brief answer. I just didn\'t feel educated and I really wish the approach was more friendly from both Dr. MacGregor and his assistant.I was supposed go back and was expecting to receive a call for a follow up appointment since they lasered off a possible cancerous mole but still have not heard back. I would expect something like a cancerous biopsy report to be a necessary follow up but I guess not. Keep in mind it\'s been over a month since I was seen.

Maybe if you\'re a wealthy patient prepared to spend thousands of dollars on vanity treatments you get treated well here, but I had a simple and elective procedure for something that annoyed me, and apparently it annoyed Dr. MacGregor and his entire staff as well. I felt very dismissed throughout my experience, even mocked, and all of that would have been fine, as I thought it was basically going to be an in and out job, but when I went to have just a few stitches removed, I was subjected to incompetence and extreme pain. I nearly fainted from an assistant who mercilessly kept tugging on stitches that obviously weren\'t coming out easily apparently Dr. MacGregor can\'t be bothered to remove stitches himself, and I basically had to beg this assistant to stop unless she could offer some kind of anesthetic. Honestly, the whole visit seemed cruel.Adding insult to injury, when I navigated the equally excruciating patient portal to follow up and insisted on a visit to understand why something so simple seemed to have gone so wrong this office never answers the phone and you can only communicate with them on their terms and their timeline and in their system, Dr. MacGregor basically blew me off.

The first visit he listened and took his time looking at my skin. He misdiagnosed my skin problems and when the one solution for everything cream treatment didn\'t help resolve anything he refused to change the treatment or try anything else.It\'s difficult to find a good dermatologist in SF who still takes health insurance so I kept going back hoping he would be able to help. During my last visit I brought up a new problem. He said I was fine without taking a look. I don\'t have serious problems like some of the patients that come in with skin cancer, but I was concerned so I asked him to please take a look. He glanced for less than a second from several feet away and said I was fine.IMO, Dr. MacGregor is a western medicine doctor who treats patients with a cookie cutter diagnosis that may or may not work. If he doesn\'t know what the problemsolution is he should admit it or refer you to someone else instead of being condescending.I have since visited another doctor and have been diagnosed correctly.

What a relief!Upon checking in, receptionist asked for my insurance card to copy for their records. When I offered my ID, the she said it was not necessary as they take a photo for their files. They use a camera that resembles a webcam. So, if you are a new patient, be prepared to have your photo taken!Lesley introduced herself and straight way came off as extremely friendly and warm. Upon examination of my issue, she assured me that my issue was not bad at all and I just need a stronger medication. Aware of my nursing, she assured me that the med had been prescribed to other nursing moms and even pregnant women. Lesley is awesome and I\'m glad I had my appointment with her.

Over a year ago, in November, I picked up a very nasty bit of athlete\'s foot and boils, most likely from a public pool I had been away from for a while. In a nutshell, My GP and a referred podiatrist treated the problem with topicals and antibiotics. Over that year, and with the help of epsom salts, things got better to the point of only one foot being affected, but it was pretty bad, with cycles of calm, then oozing lesions and boils, quite painful at times. Thinking I possibly had MRSA, I saw my GP again and he gave me some names for referrals and I set up an appointment with Dr. MacGregor\'s office. Leslie Bowler took my case and biopsied the foot tissue, and after the results came back negative, prescribed Clobetasol for what she believed was Morphea, a rare type of skin atrophy. It seems to have done the trick and jeez, do I feel better.Getting set up with their 450 Derm patient portal was a pain at first, but I called the receptionist, and she politely helped me out.

I have severe to moderate adult acne with cystics and comedones that wouldn\'t go away. I\'ve been working with Christina Hampton and Leslie Bowler in getting my acne under control for a few months now with cortisone injections, prescription topicals, and oral medications. With a careful combo of a custom treatment plan to get my skin under control, I\'m seeing phenomenal results. The ugly word \'Accutane\' was suggested to me more than once and I kept declining insisting that there is another way. I should paint this picture about what my derm office was up against with my skin. I always had a problem with comedones on my forehead but had it somewhat under control with Proactiv Solution when it first came out but ended up not working after several years of use. My cheeks exploded with comedones and cystics entering my 30\'s at full blown adult acne. There were many times where I lost count on how many cystics I had at a time. Sometimes, the cystics would turn purple for several weeks making it near impossible to cover up with make up. Forget about going to the gym with make up as it would sweat off with what I was using then. I started going to Christina Hampton getting on Spironolactone, Acanya, and Atralin in addition to seeing my facialist it was going in the right direction but not quite. As I was getting cortisone injections seems like every week. After a few months, I saw Leslie Bowler. She got me on Doxycycline and Tazorac Retin A the mother of all RetinA\'s. She told me that the Doxycycline would immediately work on my cystics as the Spironolactone had some time to work which would give me faster results. And the Tazorac will work on all the comedones that was causing congestion all over my face but mainly my cheeks.

I\'m seeing PHENOMENAL results with the Tazorac added. My cheeks have cleared so much that I don\'t need extractions as often. I can see the scars actually fading with the cystics gone from the doxy. Even if I do get cystics, they purge and I can remove them myself in a matter of 23 days.

I am a 60 year old man who keeps his head shaved and because of the lack of hair that would normally be used to hide any scar tissue, a traditional neck lift wasn\'t right for me.We discussed a Short Scar Neck Lift that is performed through a small incision under the chin.

There was never a minute where I felt pressured by him or his staff to make an appointment and that was very important to me.

The entire medical staff was so friendly and just wanted to make sure I was comfortable. After surgery I was surprised that I was pretty comfortable.

Not only is he a great listener and is far from judgmental, he also was very confident and knowledgeable, and explained every angle of the procedure I was to expect, from presurgery to post, years in the future, any risks, EVERYTHING.  I had concerns of risks involved with surgery, and he went into much detail regarding complications and all risks that I was going to face which thankfully I never encountered.

The way that I was treated by Dr. Elyassnia and his staff left me with nothing but fond memories of this surgery. I honestly have nothing but positive things to say about my whole experience. Three weeks after surgery, I am very pleased with my results as Dr. Elyassnia took note and accomplished everything I wanted. He is a truly gifted plastic surgeon, and since my surgery, people keep asking me which doctor it was who was able to create such a natural change. I highly recommend Dr. Elyassnia to anyone looking to get a rhinoplasty, or any other procedure. He is simply the best.'),(2515,248,5,'Dr. Elyassnia is a very skilled and patient doctor. I have wanted breast implants for about ten years, but was always nervous about undergoing surgery. I really appreciate that Dr. Eyassnia was always available to answer my questions.

I would highly recommend Dr. Elyassnia to anyone considering breast augmentation!'),(2516,248,5,'Dr. Dino is so passionate about his work, and as other reviewers have mentioned, it is his honesty that sets him a part from other plastic surgeons. That means that his work is not driven by financial reasons, but because he is passionate about the art behind his work.

When you call the phone is answered by a real person, Juana, who is a true gem, and very helpful.Dr. Gendelman is competent and confident. He voluntarily explains his diagnosis and treatment suggestions with the medical information I need. This allows me to follow up with my own research so I can better understand and trust what I\'m being told. He is not bothered or patronizing when I come in with my strong opinions, selfdiagnoses and attitude, and he listens and hears what I have to say.  In 30 years, he is also the first physician to successfully treat my high blood pressure. And he doesn\'t humiliate me with the let\'s step on the scale routine, or make me sit naked in a cold room with a paper gown for company. He keeps his schedule and while efficient, is caring and thorough.'),(2522,249,5,'Dr. Gendelman is a caring person and a good family doctor. We have been his patients for the past 6 years.

I had a 2pm appointment and was seen PROMPTLY at 2pm. I definitely appreciated that! Dr. Gendleman was \'too the point\', without being rude. I appreciated his straight forward, decisive manner. If you\'re looking for a clinic where the doctor will hold your hand delicately and tell you how nice your hair looks this probably isn\'t it. But if you are just looking to have your health care needs met efficiently & swiftly check them out. In short I probably wouldn\'t come here for a Pap Smear... but I\'d definitely come if I had a stomach bug or needed some vaccines.'),(2524,249,5,'Dr. Gendelman is good. Direct, honest, thorough, and caring. Another reviewer described his manner as gruff. Over a few visits I\'ve come to see this as cutting through BS and wanting to address problems directly and efficiently, not a lack of caring. I can imagine this style not suiting everyone but it suits me. Tell him exactly why you are there, what your concerns are, and he will address them. He\'s also more methodical than other doctors or at least verbalizes it more in excluding possible diagnoses.

In fact when you\'re there he\'s all business, and I know cause I\'ve tried to joke with him and he kind of stops, looks at me over the tops of his glasses, gives a little laugh and then he\'s like ok, can we get back to the topic at hand ?He is super dialed on giving you a really clear explanation of whatever is going on, and he LOVES to whip out his pen and draw diagrams on the paper that covers the examining table which is pretty funny, but I have to say, you don\'t leave with questions.For me that is cool because I never go to the doctor without going to the internet first, for me medical care is collaborative, I walk in informed as a lay person can be.Also, couple years back I was out of work, without coverage, and needed some meds, Doc G hooked me up with some samples to help me out.So cool guy, never had a negative experience of any kind with him, and when I was down he help a brother out, so for that I want to put the good word on the Doc, he\'s a good guy.'),(2526,249,4,'I\'ve been with Dr\' Gendelman for about 4 years.He is fast but efficient and within 10 min of appointment I usually get an answer to all my issues and I usually come with several unrelated things going on.I needed his receptionist to fax me my physical and she did it in a matter of minutes.I didn\'t really have any serious problems, but those few things I came with were diagnosed and treated appropriately, no complains.I don\'t really care about bedside manners as much as for professionalism, so to me they were fine.'),(2527,249,5,'Dr. Gendelman is a wonderful, caring and highly knowledgeable doctor.

I have to say that I am a much healthier person now than I was 3 years ago, thanks to Dr. Gendelman.He always seems to know about new medications on the market, and he has changed my cholesterol and blood pressure medication several times in attempts to achieve the best results. And he has! I have never felt rushed in his office, and he rarely makes me wait. I usually shoot for the 11:30 am appointment  that way, I can leave my office in the Financial District at 11 am and be back at work by 12:30 or so. Parking is a bit of a problem, but it\'s manageable.If I had to mention something negative about Dr. Gendelman, I would say that their office equipment is indeed really old. So what?

But in terms of reproductive discussionsissues, he basically failed me and I will never see him again, even though, like I said, his medical decisions were not bad; it was his communication style that prevented him from being a person who could make me feel supported and cared for as a female patient.

He discusses treatment options with you  laying out all the pros and cons and helping you make informed choices. 4. He accurately spotted my friend\'s serious condition and got him to the best specialists. Not only that, he took the time to talk to him and help ease his fears and concerns. 5. It is fairly easy to get an appointment with him, so you if you have a problem you get care  instead of sitting at home worrying and begging for an appointment, as I have had to do with other doctors.6. His office is across the street from the UCSF Mt. Zion complex so if you need other tests or specialists he can usually get you to someone good quickly.His offices are modest so if you need a slick fancy office to feel like you are getting good medical care, this may not be the practice for you.

I went in today for a physical with Dr. Lucas, which I did have to schedule a month + in advance but that\'s been the norm for me for such appointments. I was seen within 5 minutes of checking in at the office and I didn\'t have to wait at all for Dr. Lucas. She is friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and answered all my questions.

Really a problem for me to get adequate healthcare ...not because of providers but because of incompetent, poor manner staff. ZERO customer service.'),(2562,251,3,'This is only my 2nd review on Yelp but I thought this was important. I chose Dr. Lucas and Dr. Fong\'s practice because of the good Yelp reviews and their association with CPMC. Dr. Lucas was very nice and chatty when I finally met her face to face, but I have several major problems with this office which are causing me to consider moving elsewhere:1 I have been happily using the same prescrip. for years and just needed a new prescription written to get refills. Despite having NO problems with it and a toprated doctor in another city recommending it for me, Dr. Lucas insisted that I switch to a different prescription which has MANY MANY known negative side effects, including several lawsuits against it. This gives me a strong suspicion that she is receiving illegal kickbacks for prescribing this particular drug.  2 I made it very clear during my visit that I could only afford to use a GENERIC drug. She went ahead and prescribed me the above branded drug anyway, and checked the box that prohibits you from getting the generic substitute. I had to make a 2nd trip back to the office and get the nurse to get me a corrected prescription just to order the generic.3 It is extremely difficult to see the real doctor. While the physician\'s assistant was nice, I am paying to see a real doctor. You basically need 2 month\'s notice to see her. If you have an urgent situation, forget about it.On the plus side, their office admins are very, very nice.'),(2563,251,5,'Not sure what the boutique thing is about that the other reviewer was talking about. Dr. Lucas has been my PCP for several years now. I love her. I went to a few others until I found her. Even though she only sees me 12x a year, she always remembers my stories and where we las left off with my life. I like that she cares enough to remember her patients. I feel like I have a great relationship with her. Also, if something minorly urgent comes up, I can call and she will call me back! I know she calls her patients back during lunch and after hours... she stays late to do this. And she even offers med advice and prescribes during these calls. So to me, i don\'t think this office is about going after your money. If so, then they would make come in so they can charge for a visit. Instead, Dr. Lucas knows I\'m in paindiscomfort and she does her best to make sure i\'m covered on the spot with advice, home treatments, prescriptions if needed and followup instructions.I really like Dr. Lucas. I also have never had an issue getting an appt. For physicals, yes, you have to wait a while she\'s good and she\'s got patients, but if you become a patient and then need to see her, she makes the time. I recommend becoming her patient,... it\'s worth the wait for a good, thorough, caring, intelligent gracious doctor.'),(2564,251,2,'I can\'t get an appointment with her.

There are some on the HMO who are still on their books, but if they\'re not on the Boutique membership, they won\'t get priority. I didn\'t want to fork over $4,000 the amount my husband and I would have to pay to get preferential treatment so I have since switched to another medical office: Metropolitan office at 110 Sutter.

I felt already very uncomfortable, why would I lie in the first place about not received prescription order? And it was also not my job to find out their mistake.

He often seemed to rush the appointment, would forget pretty much everything I came to see him for the last time, and wouldn\'t ask if anything else I needed to discuss with him.His solutions for conditions were poor as well. I went to a new medical group who was very thorough and after 1 treatment for a condition i\'m 90 percent of the way there versus the multiple near worthless trips to see Dr. Siu.I think I didn\'t realize what I was missing out on with other doctors because it was easy to see him and get in and out. If you don\'t go to the doctor much and only need super basic stuff he can be a good guy. If you have more serious things you need to address, i\'d keep looking.'),(2604,253,5,'Trying to find a last minute check up appointment on a Friday is nearly impossible. Dr. Siu\'s office was so helpful in creating an appointment on short notice. Thank you!!!'),(2605,253,2,'First off let me say that I think Dr. Siu is a nice person and has a great personalityAs a doctor, I feel like he could have been a lot more thorough.I got back from my honeymoon in Mexico and got sick the next day. I thought it was a standard stomach virus but it wouldn\'t go away. I don\'t have a regular doc so I made an appointment with Dr. Siu after reading all the glowing reviews on Yelp.His office is in West Portal. Get there a little early to find free parking because there is a lot of construction going on in the area and no parking signs are all over the place.The front desk is very brief but nice. Gave me standard paperwork to fill out. Some of the questions were funny, like Do you suffer from erectile dysfunction?... Sounded like an opportunity to sell some drugs, if you know what I mean. This is definitely an office that is in bed with the drug companies. There was a drug sales rep in the office who was chumming it up with the doctor. Giving him free stuff, you know the drill.After filling out paperwork, I sat for about 5 minutes and the Doc saw me, which is really good. Usually docs keep you waiting upwards of up to an hour. Must have been a slow day, lucky for me.Doc introduced himself, very warm.He looked at my medical history and said Wow, how am I supposed to treat all this in under a half an hour? Not the most professional thing to say but he is a jokester so if you don\'t have a thick skin and can\'t take jokes aimed at your medical history, don\'t go.In the end, I forked over $30 as my copay. He didn\'t do any blood work, which I don\'t think was smart. Especially, when the patient tells you they just got back from an international trip. Didn\'t even do a complete physical. Just checked my blood pressure and my breathing. Didn\'t issue me an antibiotic for my virus. Could have given me some of those free samples he got earlier. Just told me to keep on doing what I\'ve been doing which is eat bananas and toast and go get Immodium. Great!!I was too weak to argue or suggest what he should do, so I just kept my mouth shut and laughed at his jokes. I guess this strain of virus make you a sucker.So if you get the flu and have $30 lying around, go to the Dr. Siu comedy show where you can hear jokes about your medical history and be told to eat bananas and saltines. Oh yeah, but he would make a great drinking buddy so it\'s a catch 22.'),(2606,253,5,'Just saw Dr. Siu. He is very professional and easy to talk to. Even though I\'m a new patient, there was no wait once I got my paperwork finished. What I really liked is a lot of doctors will immediately presribe pills for just about anything since that\'s what people expect. Dr. Siu gave me some alternatives to try first before trying any prescription medication.FOLLOW UP: His diagnosis was right on. Aok now.'),(2607,253,5,'If you are looking for a family doctor, Dr. Siu is wonderful. The service is personal, efficient and professional. He is wonderful with kids. Don\'t let the small office or his modest demeanor fool you, he is also a visiting professor at UC Medical Center.For the past ten years he has taken care of my family through thick and thin. He answers calls, sees you when you really need to see him and does every procedure himself....no overworked nurses. When was the last time a physician gave you a shot, drew blood or performed an ekg? He does it all and that makes his office so special. Who would know I would find a small town doctor in the big city. Thank You Dr. Siu!'),(2608,253,5,'Dr. Siu was great! Where we disagreed, he really listened to me, treated me with respect. He asked me lots of questions, wanting to know all kinds of things about my health baseline; I was clearly NOT a statistic to him! Though I came to discuss having a metal screw taken out of my ankle, we covered all the bases. A really nice guy  I really felt comfortable with him, and knew that I could trust him.'),(2609,253,5,'I have been a patient of Dr Siu for about 12 years! My Mother, Wife and adult children have also been under the care of Dr. Michael Siu. I am just shocked at all these misleading reviews, Especially the guy who\'s 93 year old mother fell down. First of all, If my mother ever fell down, common sense would for me to call 911 and not wait 3 weeks. The other review, someone says they stepped back in time to the 50\'s. I guess you haven\'t been to SF General or ST. Lukes. I would like to set the record straight. Michael Siu is a very family orientated Dr. He saved my life 11 years ago and then just recently saved my mothers life by ordering tests and sending her to specialist. My mother was diagnosed with lung cancer. Thanks to Dr Michael Siu and the specialist, my mother is now cancer free. Dr. Micheal Siu always goes above and beyond the call of duty. If anybody has a problem or is not sure of anything, all you have to do is ask questions! Dr. Michael Siu will always answer them.'),(2610,253,4,'I switched to Dr. Siu because I felt my last physician was impersonal and did not spend enough time assessing my symptoms. Dr. Siu, I felt, was very thorough when discussing my current symptoms, but also other factors lifestyle choices, medical history, etc in order to properly diagnose me. Furthermore, he was understanding of the fact that I am the type of person that likes to look at other options before jumping into antibiotics or vaccines. Most doctors try to push drugs, and I like that Dr. Siu listened to me as a patient. I\'ve had a great experience so far, and I hope to continue seeing him along with my family.'),(2611,253,5,'Michael Siu is so awesome. At first, I was a little hesistant that he was my doctor because I was an awkward teenager and just discovered that I had to do my annual girl exams..and now I had to go to a MAN DOCTOR? Um, no thanks, my girl organs are working juuuust fine.But..Dr. Siu is so nice and is very attentive. He answers all my questions, and his office staff is very nice.'),(2612,253,4,'I was referred to Dr. Siu by a friend of mine, when I complained about my doctor never having time to accomodate me. All I can say is how glad I am to FINALLY find a doctor that cares about his patients and can make time for you! I needed to see him before a trip abroad, and given the short notice, he certainly made time to see me. Thanks again Dr. Siu!During my first visit, I was impressed that Dr. Siu took the time to get to know me and ask me about my overall health. Even if he had a next appointment, I didn\'t feel rushed. Most doctors would carry on with their business, but Dr. Siu definitely tried to engage in nice conversation. That was a plus! My overall check up was a good experience and it felt really good to have a doctor answer all of my questions and not be rushed out the door! Parking can be a challenge though so I opt to take the muni from the city to get there. But overall, I like him and intend to keep him as my primary doctor for a long time.'),(2613,253,1,'I advise you to not just look at the overall Yelp score when you\'re researching on someone or something, that\'s as important as finding a good doctor. Please read the most recent individual reviews and gauge.I chose Dr. Siu because he was part of my network, a private physician less waiting than at a clinic, and he got a good Yelp rating. Well, now that I\'ve experienced otherwise, I want to make sure others don\'t repeat my mistake.It\'s true there\'s less wait and he has more availability, but it\'s also because he\'s really a FORPROFIT doctor. He overschedules patients and only sees them for like 5 min at most for everything. To try to talk to him more to tell him what\'s wrong with you and to learn what you can do to prevent things, please save your breath.He is okay if you just want to go in and tell him that you have an idea of what\'s wrong with you, for a simple cold or preventative shot. He will be very fast in prescribing drugs.But he is NOT the doctor to go to if you have something serious or you have no idea why you\'re feeling sick. Because chances are, he doesn\'t know what he\'s doing. And he is impatient, rude, and condescending, as others described.I\'ve gone to him for like half a dozen times in the span of 2 months, trying to get a correct diagnosis for the pain that I\'m suffering. But he dismisses me the first few times with antibiotics and painkillers. When the pain keeps recurring, I finally asked him for a referral. And the ones he recommended don\'t even accept female patients. I had to find my own specialist. He advised me not to go to the specialist after I made my appointment because he doesn\'t think I have anything serious.When my pain and old problem keeps coming back and he had to call me to tell me that the lab results actually indicates I have a serious infection, that was the last straw. He has caused me so much more suffering by wasting my precious time and money and making me feel worse than I already was. I don\'t trust anything he says anymore. I will find another doctor. And I advise you to do the same!'),(2614,253,5,'Dr. Siu is a wonderful physician. I saw him a few times a couple of years ago as I was having a bit of a random collection of symptoms, and he was extremely thorough  had me create a family tree listing date of birth, datecause of death, and any known illnesses as far back as I or my family members could remember. Using this and other tools he figured things out and got me on a path to feeling much better. This past week I\'ve been hit with a horrible cold and I called today to see if I could get an appointment sometime soon. Even though I haven\'t been into his office in a couple of years, they squeezed me in for an appointment *today.* In the past, I\'ve had similar situations with other primary care doctors  calling in, sick, and asking to be seen  and I\'ve been told they\'re all booked up, or given an appointment a couple of weeks out. I could not be happier with his care or service his office provides.'),(2615,253,5,'Dr. Siu is a wonderful physician, and very importantly, he never makes me feel bad about myself.

The doctor knows all of my bad habits, unhealthy practices, and tendency to push myself too hard  and he delivers advice with the caring manner of a concerned parent  someone who acknowledges the problem, and will work with you to get through it.  He explains everything very thoroughly, too, which I love.My husband and I have been patients of Dr. Siu for about 7 years, and he has never let us down. He\'s seen us through 1 appendicitis me, 1 hernia Mr. S, preventative shots, physical exams, and countless treatments for colds and flu. He seems to know immediately, like magic, what is wrong with us. On the day of my appendectomy, I came in with what I thought was food poisoning, and a few hours later he had gotten me into the hospital for a CAT scan, followed immediately by surgery. I will be forever grateful to him for that day.Yesterday I went in with the most terrible cold I\'ve had in years, and they took me in last minute, working around my schedule not easy. He knew immediately that I had a sinus infection, took the time to explain exactly what was happening to me, and prescribed the antibiotics I needed. He looked a little concerned when I told him I had to fly to Asia on Sunday considering that at the time, I couldn\'t breathe or hear, my equilibrium was off, and I looked like death, but he said that I would be OK to go if I started my treatment IMMEDIATELY. See? He didn\'t tell me no, but was clear on what I had to do. And like an obedient child, I am following his advice exactly.I have complete trust in Dr. Siu, which is further underlined by the fact that he also is my OBGYN.

The old equipment looks like it\'s straight from the 50\'s.Dr. Siu is a nice guy, but not very professional. As others here said, his jokes sound a bit out of place. He also does not seem to be on top of things. I complained to him couple of times about extreme exhaustion. He did show honest concern, and ran some tests partial that did detect minor anemia. But he didn\'t make a link between the anemia, the exhaustion and possible lack of iron. It turned out that my iron levels were very low and the cause for the exhaustion, because by taking iron pills per my sister\'s suggestion I started feeling much better. That was a simple fix, and I would expect my doctor to suggest it, given the lab results and a preexisting condition that also supports it. This could have spared me several months of feeling extremely weak.'),(2617,253,2,'My insurance co picked Dr. Siu as my PCP for me and I was about to change their selection when I saw the great reviews on Yelp.

He was definitely very friendly and personable but that\'s not exactly what I\'m looking for in a doctor. It\'s a nice to have though.I finally decided to write this review because I recently came down with the flu and having heard that some treatments can be effective if taken very early on I called the office and asked if I could come in right away for a prescription. They said they\'d check with the doctor and asked my for my number and my pharmacy so they could call in a prescription if appropriate. I never heard back from them. I called the pharmacy and they never called in a prescription.

I moved to SF in July, and I kept thinking I should find a doctor just in case I would get sick...but I never get sick, so I procrastinated.

Based on where I lived then and your reviews, I chose Dr. Siu, and he fixed me up. About a month later, I went to see him, because I\'d gone through this couple of weeks of mango addiction LOL and developed an alarming rash all over my lower legs which began to spread upwards. I thought I was having death by mango! Well, that turned out to be poison oak I\'d apparently come in contact with  I still don\'t get that, I guess it blew onto me at the beach! Dr. Siu fixed me up again. This is a very cool doctor. He is personable, professional, and even humorous.

He is also on top of the latest medications that come out. Hence, he recommendation what you need and will always do his best to save his patients money by prescribing generics when possible.

I spoke with Dr. Siu last week and he categorically denied filing a report with adult protective services and told me to lighten up and get on with my life. I met with APS today and they confirmed that it was Dr. Siu himself who reported me. He was very dramatic, suggesting that they investigate me urgently. When she found out that he waited over three months to file his report, which was only after he found out about the Yelp review, she was quite surprised. Dr Siu should not have wasted APS\'s time, simply to try and get even with me for writing my review. In my entire life, I have probably written two dozen reviews, in various forums. The is the first time that I have ever written a negative one. I am not suggesting that anybody stop seeing him if they are happy, but people should have important information like this so they can make informed decisions, particularly such as the others who have found his diagnostic skills uncertain. He refused to provide necessary care to a ninetythree year old patient, who had entrusted him with her care. That is the most egregious thing he did, along with violating her privacy be discussing her with another of his patients, who is her next door neighbor. Do you want your doctor gossiping about your private confidences, with your neighbors? Dr. Sui lied to me and about me. He filed a false report with Adult Protective Sevices, out of retribution for me having posted a review of his failure to properly care for a ninety three year old patient, who was in pronounced distress. It is a matter of fact that he is a liar. It is a matter of my opinion that he is also a quack and a gossip.

He prescribed supplements and herbal tinctures to allow my body to become strong again enough to continue treatment.

When we found out we were pregnant two years ago I went to an OB my PC sent me to and I was terrified. He couldn\'t find the baby on an ultrasound machine twice which I totally understand can happen but then he told me because I didn\'t see anything I must have miscarried. Two weeks later I did almost lose the baby guess I was still pregnant and though he did step up his game and help save our baby, I knew he could not be my doctor for another 8 months. I have Lupus and the one good thing this other doctor did for me was to send me to a high risk doctor who I would see in conjunction with my regular OB. She saw how stressed out I was and scared and sent me immediately to Dr. Kim. Seriously, that day changed everything. Dr. Kim was beyond there for us the entire way. She and my other doctor worked flawlessly together. I saw her every other week for check ups and ultrasounds the entire time and she was incredible. She was cautious and very through in making sure my labs and numbers were ok, the baby was growing and if I was sick I was taken care of as much as our baby was. When we went to mexico on vacation she wrote up a letter for us to take with us, just incase I needed to see any other doctor while we were there. Luckily we were going to a american owned resort so we knew we were in good hands and so did she, but the fact she did it was so incredibly soothing and amazing. The day finally came to meet our little guy and while naturally we were nervous we also knew we were incredibly taken care of. Dr. Kim and our other doctor made sure that they were both going to be the ones on call the night before we were induced, be on call the day we checked into the hospital and be on call the day after. No matter what they would both be there to deliver our baby and that meant so much to us. As smooth as they made the whole plan, things did not go as planned at all. When my epidural slipped and started going directly into my blood stream Dr, Kim was there instantly to figure it out. Unfortunately there was not enough time to fix the problem and my son decided it was time to be born at the exact moment I had ZERO pain medication in my body so I would have an all natural birth thanks alot kid but Dr. Kim got me through it. My husband did too, but she was seriously a savior. ***VERY IMPORTANT***When you pick a doctor you want to make sure you like them and get along with them and enjoy your meetings etc. However you really are making sure that when shit goes down they will step up to the plate and react in the best way possible.

You are strong. You can do this. I know you can. I was in shock and terrified from having to do this all on my own and being in such sudden pain that I felt defeated and she literally got me to a place where I could safely deliver my child.That moment when everything matters and your scared out of our mind and things are not going right is when you want THE best doctor by your side and I can assure anyone, she was just that.We sent her cards and delivered a thank you orchid at our first check up after the baby and she was just as amazing and sweet as she ever was.  We are now thinking of having a second and I can\'t wait to see Dr. Kim after almost 2 years, which is what got me to write a yelp review today. There is no way I would ever go to anyone else, no way I want anyone else on our side and I will continue to refer countless friends to her over and over again. Thank you so much Dr. Kim... hopefully we see you soon for this next chapter in our lives Katie, Josh and Beckett'),(2638,255,1,'Lowering my rating to one star after doctor failed to provide requested referral costing me several wasted ours and weeks before rescheduling.Pay no attention to these reps replying here saying they\'ll help. They won\'t. Darryl is a paper pusher who sends you to yet another voice mail of some other paper pusher. After 10+ years with this doctor, I am leaving due to the greed and atrocious office practices of Sutter Pacific, including their notoriously over priced services at CPMC. Their costs are 510x what I pay at other facilities in my insurance network. They pay their executives exorbitant salaries yet pay no taxes. They are a blight on society and it\'s a shame this fine doctor has aligned herself with them.'),(2639,255,1,'I get the sense that this place is an assembly line for routine pregnancies. That may be fine for you, but I experienced just how unexpectedly volatile pregnancy and delivery can be. It became very clear that this is not the place to be in that situation.Most of my review and decision to leave reflect this protocols of this practice. This has a critical impact on quality of care and is much more important than if you like your OB or not. While Dr Kim may not have been the source of these issues, she also didn\'t do anything to overcome them, nor did she take a personal interest in my level of care either. In the end, I spent two months at Stanford Hospital following delivery and am lucky to be alive. I cringe when I think of what my outcome could have been if I hadn\'t switched. My experience dealing with this practice on top of an extremely stressful pregnancy was so, so unnecessary.I met Dr K as a low risk second pregnancy patient at 12 wks. I developed a complication and became a high risk patient, then subsequently became an extremely high risk patient. Throughout this time, nothing changed from their basic protocols for routine care. Ultimately, I found this lack of attention unacceptable and became genuinely concerned for my outcome and switched to a new practice at 31 wks. Ironically, the most proactive and responsive I saw this practice was in thwarting me from leaving. The additional stresses placed on me were extremely disappointing; I hope my review saves others from a similar experience. 1. Scheduling: They recommend switching between Drs since they rotate for delivery. Really, it\'s because you won\'t be able to get on the same Drs schedule for multiple appts. Dr K told me to book my next 2 months worth for every two wks. The next open appt with her was in 6 wks, they recommended I see another Dr. I was having complications and wanted the continuity of care of one Dr. I was told to leave a msg. It was disappointing that this was an exception and not standard of care when I required more than a biweekly pee sample and uterus measurement.2. Phone availability: Want to leave a msg for your Dr? The recording admits not to expect a response for 72 hours. Want to talk to a live person? HA! Their phone system does not allow it and 0 is not an option. Eventually I started highjacking the appt line and refused to hang up until they gave me to the function I needed and no paging system instead of VM either.3. Urgent Nurse availability: I was concerned I was having an incident and wanted to speak to someone. I selected the option for an urgent care nurse. I was connected to VM. I left a msg. I redialed with no change for the next half hour before I gave up to put all my faith in Dr Google. 45 mins later I got a call back. I expressed concern at the delay and was told they are busy and sometimes they can\'t get the phone. I did get a same day appt, but the gap made me concerned, anxious, and ultimately, unsupported by my practice.4. Disconnect between practice and diagnostic: I went to the CPMC Prenatal Diagnostic Center for my ultrasounds and labs please also see that yelp review if you are still considering this practice. This is where my complications were discovered. They did share reports and general phone updates with Dr K, but I wanted to discuss with her, as my OB who I felt was primarily managing my care. Once when asking questions of Dr K she admitted that she hadn\'t seen my ultrasounds and was working off of a two line text summary of my visit. I found that OB would often defer to diagnostic and vice versa. OB, diagnostic and I were never in the same room at the same time and I felt I was left to project manage my care and ensure that the functions were synced up and that I asked the right questions of each. This left me super stressed out on if the bases were covered.At 29 wks I was diagnosed with the big complication and promptly left Dr K a msg. Via Dr Google I found that Stanford has a group that specializes in my complication. Before I received a return call from this practice I already had via Stanford an ultrasound, an MRI, and was arranged to be admitted to the hospital. 10 full days after I left the msg for Dr K, someone called to tell me she was out and would call me the following week. As a high risk patient, shouldn\'t I have known she would be on vacation? And, it\'s a group mailbox, so why didn\'t they have another OB return my msg in 72 hrs? The icing on the cake was that Stanford required a letter of transfer to accept me and it is against Sutter Health policy to refer for something they treat. I spent hours trying to get through to and pleading with administrative staff, office mgrs, and OBs. I was free to transfer care, but they would not refer me. It was a clash of protocols which left me, the patient, screwed. I ended up tracking down the since retired OB who delivered my first two years ago who wrote me the referral so that I could get the care I needed.'),(2640,255,3,'Dr. Kim is great. however, the office staff and reservation system is ABYSMAL!

She and John Fassett my nursemidwife, see my review on him as well were partners in the birth of my second daughter, and since the first was a csection after 9 hours of pushing, we weighed the options and decided that a VBAC was probably not the right choice for me. The prenatal care was great, and the office is pretty much always on time so I could get in and out of my appointments pretty quickly. Also, the office is right across the street from CPMC which means that when they are called away for a delivery, they get back to the office pretty quickly. Dr. Kim saw me for a few prenatal appointments when John was unavailable and it was obvious that they have a great working relationship because the care was totally seamless. During the day of the csection, Dr. Kim was so nice and walked me through the procedure every step of the way. The best part is that the incision is incredibly small & clean, healed super well, and I hardly had any pain at all. In fact, I went off the narcotic pain medication in a few days. I could not be more pleased with the care I got from Dr. Kim and would highly highly recommend her to any of my pregnant friends.

Having an obstetrician who is compassionate, smart, professional, and genuinely excited for you is SO important. Dr Kim is all of this and above. I even had a rare conditioncomplication that put me at a higher risk towards the end of my pregnancy and though I completely scared myself to death by looking it up on the internet Note to pregnant friends, stay away from Dr Google and trust your REAL doctor!, Dr. Kim made me feel safe and gave us several options on what to do that were in line with what I read. The result was a safe and pretty much perfect delivery of our beautiful baby girl. Sadly, I had to say my final goodbye to Dr Kim recently, as my husband and I moved to San Mateo and it really isn\'t convenient to be making the trip up to SF anymore especially towards the end of the pregnancy with multipleweek appointments. I would absolutely keep her as my doctor if we lived closer.

I see a lot of rave reviews here from people who have used her for obstetric services, so I should preface this review and say I\'ve never pushed a kid out. I have only seen Dr. Kim for gynecology. That said, in the three years I\'ve been her patient, I\'ve only ever seen her a total one one time since she never has availability. I have no problem with Dr. Kim, but it\'s her office that is simply atrocious. Couldn\'t give less stars. After my insurance changed, there was an issue with one of my prescriptions. After being overly patient with them while they sort it out for 4 weeks !!! I was still without. It\'s near impossible to get through the phone system and after you do they immediately put you on hold. They won\'t let you ask for a refill over the phone  the pharmacy must fax a request in, but they also can\'t accept anything that hasn\'t been sent from an analog fax machine. What the hell does that even mean?? Is this 1999? I have been a patient in the office for 3 years and they still have no idea who I am  when they leave messages they can\'t even say my name right, and mind you it\'s a pretty common name. People with a 3rd grade education could pronounce this. And then, after one especially *helpful* phone conversation with them, they say they\'ve lost my files. What the actual *uck.

Third, any time I have called with a question, she has always personally called me back within the same day.

I wouldn\'t say she was warm & bubbly then, but it didn\'t bother me.For my next appt, I\'d read over and over that you can schedule a preconception exam to be looked at for any potential fertility issues. I didn\'t realize my pap wasn\'t due until 5 months later. The nurse seemed confused as to why I\'d be doing an exam, but gave me a paper robe nonetheless. When Dr. Kim arrived in the room she was downright condescending and baffled as to why I\'d be getting an exam done when I wasn\'t due for a pap. I said I was there for my preconception exam and she haughtily said, There is no such thing. The look on her face was so selfrighteous. I could feel myself turn red in the face from embarrassment. We discussed a few things and she was somewhat helpful, but I still can\'t get over how uncomfortable she made a prospective mom feel. I will never return.I\'m now 5 weeks pregnant and thought better of giving her office my business. To add insult to injury, when I attempted to schedule my prenatal appointments assuming i WAS going to keep her as my OB the receptionist very pointedly said, you\'ll get two appointments. The first is an ultra sound to check out the baby. Please hold all questions for the second visit a week later. This first visit will be very short.

After seeing Dr. Akizuki the second time, he concluded that I have a knee plica. He said that it is not a serious conditions and that a lot of people have it too. He gave me the choice of either conservative treatment or surgery. I am an athlete, and was not willing to let go of sports, so I decided to go with surgery. Surgery was quick.

On the third day, I was back to school limping. Of course I was carrying the crutches in case. I was very persistent with physical therapy, home exercises, and proper diet so I guess that has contributed to the speedy recovery as well. Full range of motion happened 6 weeks post op.

I would see Dr Akizuki for anything Orthopedic in the future.'),(2677,256,5,'Dr Kenneth Akizuki is a top notch orthopedic surgeon. I should know. I\'ve had 3 major joint surgeries in the past 2 years and Dr. Akizuki has now performed 2 of them.    After having mixed feelings about the outcome of my first knee surgery with another orthopedic surgeon, I embarked on a quest to find the best of the best to repair my badly shattered shoulder motorcycle accident. I had PPO insurance through United Health Care at that time that allowed me to see as many doctors as I wanted so I made appointments with and saw the top 7 highest rated San Francisco sports medicine doctors on Yelp. I was amazed at how differently each doctor diagnosed my complex injury. The first 2 Doctors I saw actually suggested that since it was my left arm and I\'m right handed that I wouldn\'t need surgery and should accept that I\'d just have a bum left wing for the rest of my life! I couldn\'t believe it...These are top rated Yelp doctors! Each subsequent doctor I saw diagnosed something in my shoulder that all of the previous experts had missed.      Dr. Akizuki took the longest to get an appointment with as he is in very high demand. It was absolutely worth the wait though. Dr. Akizuki looked at my Xrays, MRIs, and CT scan and very quickly diagnosed important aspects of my injury that had been previously overlooked by 6 other experts. The entirety of my injury now seemed so clear once Dr. Akizuki had explained and showed me his analysis of my films. His bed side manner is the best I\'ve experienced and I\'ve seen many, many highly revered doctors. He is very friendly and actually takes the time to answer all of my questions and settle any concerns I may have. This is certainly why he runs behind but I wont hold that against him. I\'ll take quality over speed every day.     Dr Akizuki clearly explained my situation and options and was confident that he could reconstruct my shattered shoulder and greatly restore lost range of motion and strength. He also painted a very clear picture of what my surgery and recovery would be like and gave me an accurate timeline as well.      I have to say that Ken Akizuki performed my shoulder reconstruction flawlessly as I am now able to do pullups, swim, climb a ladder etc. . When I tore my ACL 8 months after my shoulder surgery, Dr Akizuki was of course my preferred surgeon. He handled that knee surgery with the same exceptional competency that has garnered the SF Giants trust in making him team doctor for the last few years.   I also have to mention Dr. Benjamin Ma who was very helpful and informative when I consulted his medical advice though I personally preferred Dr Akizuki. I feel like Dr. Ma would have made the same repairs during surgery though Dr. Akizuki was able to read my film more completely in advance which earned my trust.'),(2678,256,5,'dr akizuki has been my orthopedic surgeon for several years for multible injuries.i consider him the best choice i could have made.with gratitude,george fleet'),(2679,256,5,'Wow!!

I\'ve had two ACL reconstructive surgery with another doctor from SCVM Hospital and the operations went awry... so I suspected that my physician had made some errors. So, for my third ACL surgery I was advised by a friend who had received similar surgery to see Dr. Akizuki. Kenneth Akizuki answered all my questions on my first visit. He sat down and informed me well about the procedure before going into the surgery room. Several days after my surgery he called me and sought my wellbeing.

Uh yeah, sorry the surgery was rescheduled but he is the team doctor for the SF Giants so if they make it the playoffs he does have to be there.

I injured my shoulder and went to my primary car physician, who referred me to Dr. Akizuki as a really good doctor that I will need to make an appointment for months in advance. They weren\'t kidding! I called and the next appointment was in a month an half! BUT I was already in pain! I decided to make an appointment anyway and ended up seeing two doctors in the mean time, only to spend extra copay money for medicine I didnt need. Both doctors told me it was a pinchedbruised nerve. When I finally saw Dr. Akizuki, he knew right away after telling him my symptoms that I had a fracture. He made me take an MRI right away and low and behold  FRACTURE. I can totally write poor reviews for the other doctors, but I will refrain from doing so.Not only is Dr. Akizuki a GOOD doctor, he\'s very personable, friendly, smart, funny, and genuinely cares about you. He genuinely cares about you and your well being. I remember one time I was having dinner with some friends around 8pm and I received a call from Dr. Akizuki. I remembered looking at my phone  what doctor calls so late? Well, he was working late and called me to tell me about my MRI results and gave me instructions on what to do next.

Also another doctor discovered he actually messed up drilling in a part of leg and moved onto a different spot to get the donor tissue.  I can also echo how poorly the office is run and how you routinely sit around for an hour waiting to get in.'),(2685,256,5,'Our daughter a college athlete had two previous knee surgeries and it looked like she needed a third. We opted to get a second opinion rather than return to the original doctor and selected Dr. Akizuki in large part because of reviews on Yelp. It was clear from the beginning that he and his staff understood the concept of working with an athlete that needs quick action and to return to their sport as soon as is safe. The first thing Trisha, the appointment scheduler, asked when I called for an appointment was whether or not we had a recent MRI and since we did not, she set one up immediately, before we even saw the doctor  unheard of in the other ortho offices I contacted... they all wanted a preliminary visit before ordering an MRI. We got an MRI, had the appointment with Akizuki and our daughter had surgery... all within a week and a half  crucial since she was home for a brief visit during the summer and our goal was to get her back up and active as soon as possible. It has now been two months since the surgery and Dr. Akizuki has not only been involved in her rehab talking to athletic trainers at her school but has been refreshingly accommodating with regards to our limited windows of availability bringing our daughter home over a weekend for a cortisone shot in the knee and again, his office staff has been responsive and easy to deal with, always professional and very understanding.We highly recommend Dr. Akizuki  even with his busy schedule, he has proven to be an excellent choice.'),(2686,256,5,'Dr. Akizuki and his staff are wonderful.

In the Medical Field there is always gonna be overlapping appointments because people run late or something comes up. People just need to learn to be patient.I ended up having to wait 3 hours for my surgery, past my appointment time. That sucked but it wasn\'t his fault.

WTF is that? You have a job AND like baseball? Wow, so do lots of people, and they don\'t have the luxury of disrupting the lives of others by choosing not to do their job so they can watch other people play sports. There\'s a reason that orthopedic surgeons have been stereotyped as the dumb jocks of the medical world.So I ask you, is this the way you want to be treated by a surgeon? Do you want to have to set aside time to have surgery done, have your family set aside their time, and then have the doctor treat it like the least important thing in their schedule?

When I asked how much longer I would have to wait, the receptionist who was very nice went to find out and told me that I would be seen right away. I was seen right away after that but Yolanda seemed very put out that I had the nerve to complain about the wait. I understand that doctors run behind and I plan on having to wait when I go to a doctor. But I don\'t expect to sit in an office while multiple people who came in after me are seen while I\'m ignored. When I tried to pay the copay, the receptionist was very nice and said that it was waived. I was very unhappy to get a bill in the mail last week for the copay.Anyway, saw the doctor. He\'s awesome. I\'d love to go get a beer with him. He scheduled me for an MRI.Before getting the MRI, Yolanda called to schedule my surgery, including preop and postop appointments. We chose a date six weeks out. I confirmed that the appointments would be at the Sutter Street location. I showed up for my preop appt last Friday and was informed that the person with whom I had the appointment worked in Redwood City on Fridays. This would have been nice information to know! So I wasted an hour of my time going to the San Francisco office for nothing. I considered canceling the surgery at this point. If the staff is so inept that they send me to the wrong location, how can I trust the doctor to do my surgery? I decided that the doctor had little to do with his staff and that I still wanted to proceed.I ended up doing the preop with Maggie over the phone. She was wonderful and did everything in her power to to accommodate me and make up for the scheduling mistake. On Tuesday the 5th, I got a message from Yolanda saying that Dr. Akizuki was rescheduling my surgery from Friday the 8th to Wednesday. Today she explained on the phone that Dr. Akizuki has something to do with the Giants on Friday. I looked up the Giants playoff schedule and learned that the Giants have a playoff game on Friday. My surgery was cancelled for a baseball game! This has been scheduled for 6 weeks. I planned my work schedule and time off around doing it on Friday. I do not appreciate being jerked around like this. If there was an actual emergency I could understand and would be flexible. But I do not appreciate the lack of respect that was shown for my time the third time now and the doctor\'s willingness to blow me off for a baseball game. I got the impression that no one cared one bit about me or my surgery. This is not a good feeling when you\'re scheduled to be cut up.At this point, I have no more faith in this doctor.

I was to get an xrays and an MRI and call back.Once the MRI results were back, Dr. Akizuki and I began a game of phone tag. Finally in a voice mail message, he told me that my ankle was in pretty bad shape. We\'d need an appointment to sort out what to do. It was a bit annoying to have to exchange two or three phone calls to get this information, and of course, I was a bit surprised that the diagnosis had changed from a hip problem to an ankle problem. In fact, I was sure a mix up had occurred. I made another appointment.Dr. Akizuki explained that yes it was a hip problem no explanation about the ankle message and that I was a bit young for hip replacement although he didn\'t rule that out. He said we could try cortisone to the hip which would require fluoroscopic needle guidance the hip joint is tricky to find unlike a knee. I guess Dr. A. had made a simple mistake the ankle call and still believed he was OK. We scheduled the procedure.The procedure went well. Dr. Akizuki was careful to explain everything he was doing and very careful to be sure I was comfortable and painless. He inserted some dye, found the joint, and gave me a shot of cortisone. All was fine.I had a good deal of pain that evening, but the doctor had warned of that. I took a vidodin left over from a wisdom tooth extraction, but the pain was gone the next day, and the hip worked pretty well.In the next few days, however, the inside of my leg got completely black and blue as if it had been terribly bruised. Yet, there was no pain. In fact it was a little numb. I didn\'t know if the discoloration was bruising or if it might be the dye. Fairly concerned as the discoloration worsened and spread over the next few days, I telephoned the doctor again and left a message about the problem. No response. I called again. Still no response. After a month of no response, I gave up. My final word is that I think Dr. Akizuki is a competent, maybe even skilled Orthopedist. But somehow we got into an impossibly poor communication loop. I believe that my time is as important as my doctor\'s time. I don\'t believe I should have to chase a doctor down to find out what\'s happening with my health once I\'ve engaged the doctor.

As for Akizuki himself, his Yelp reviews obviously speak to his vast expertise. His bedside manner, though, is what shines in my book no nonsense, sarcastic, entertaining doc who gets straight to the point and tells you exactly what you need to do. When I first came in to have him look at my tumor, I was a bit scared, and he walked me through everything that would need to happen in the process of diagnosing it.He made me go get an MRI and worked closely with my radiologist to give me a more accurate diagnosis of my leg tumor which they both believe to be benign, and he\'s been great about monitoring the condition of my sprained ankle, which was really only a secondary concern for me in the first place but I\'m glad he kept making me come in to check in on it, because it turns out it wasn\'t in the best shape.A month later, I\'m almost walking normally, and can now breathe a bit easier knowing whatever\'s inside my leg seems to be just chillin\' there without any ill will.

He was highly recommended to me by a couple of friends and I have already myself given his name to two friends.The anterior method, which he has mastered, is the way to go. The scar is very small, the recovery much faster than with the posterior method, and there are no restrictions and no risk of dislocation. It is quite impressive. I highly recommend him to anyone needing a new hip.'),(2706,257,5,'It has been over 2 years since my hip replacement and I am finally getting to this. Simply said it is like I never had a problem.

Nurses Kathleen and Kari, anaestegiologist, OT, PT, and other hospital nurses provided fabulous assistance. If anyone is in need of a hip replacement they should definitely consider Dr.Mast for 100% satisfaction. Prior to the surgery it was very beneficial to review their thorough pamphlet on the Anterior Hip Replacement Approach and a video on the procedure performed by Dr. Mast. It was quite apparent that he had received excellent training from other outstanding doctors including his dad.

Dr. Mast answered all my questions before surgery and I went into surgery with a good understanding of the anterior approach and what I could expect during the recovery. The care provided by his team and the St. Francis Hospital staff was excellent. The afternoon of surgery I was able to walk with a walker. The next day I was discharged with a cane which I shed after about five days. I walked daily in my neighborhood and was able to take longer walks in Crissy Field and Golden Gate Park by the second and third weeks. I returned to work after four weeks and continue to make excellent progress.

I was able to lose the cane after a week, and was walking about an hour a day, slowly, after a couple of weeks. I went back to the gym at 6 weeks, and danced at 8. I walked up to my loft the day after surgery, and never took anything stronger than Tylenol once I got out of the hospital. Now, at 12 weeks, I am back to doing almost everything I love. But I have to say that I still have a tiny bit of pain when I first take a step on the surgical side, still have an ache in the groin area that varies in intensity from very mild and barely noticeable to more annoying, and I have popping in the area with certain movements. Dr. Mast diagnosed the popping as psoas tendonitis, but seemed to feel it would go away by the three months mark, which it hasn\'t. He predicted I would be at 99% at this point, and I am at about 8590. I am still so much better than I was, would recommend Dr. Mast to anyone, and hope that I will still get to that 99%.  As well as being an expert on the anterior approach, Dr. Mast is a warm, caring and accessible doctor and human. I wanted to post my less than perfect, but still great results.

I was willing to drive the distance to see him. I came from Modesto. I explained the situation to him and he immediately scheduled the surgery within two weeks of my visit. He explained very clearly the procedure and what he will be doing, and the recovery time. At the hospital he also presented good bed side manner and again explained everything clearly. His office staff and surgery team were awesome.'),(2715,257,5,'A little more than two months ago, I had hip revision surgery  on my left hip replacing the prosthesis that was put in over 20 years ago. After several hip dislocations, I decided it was time to have the revision surgery. I had inquired about this surgery with another orthopedic surgeon, and he informed me that this replacement would be considered a major surgery, and didn\'t sound too enthusiastic. But after speaking with Dr. Mast, I felt relieved and very positive about the total anterior approach replacement surgery. I\'ve had two posterior hip replacements as well as two total knee replacements, and I thought recovery from all four surgeries was easier than I expected. The staff at St. Francis was great. I went into St. Francis on Wednesday for the surgery, walked a bit after surgery, and the next morning, walked around the hospital and up and down stairs, and was sent home Thursday afternoon  walking out of the hospital with a cane. I couldn\'t believe how great I felt, and how much easier it was this time!!!Dr. Mast is truly a 5+++ star surgeon!!!!.

Free validated parking available in the basement of the St Francis building.Affable and attentive. The wait times to consult with him were a bit long, but his care more than redeemed things. After my initial xrays were taken askew, he asked the tech to retake it, patiently waiting to reconsult with me 30 minutes later, without any sense of rush. Note the offices are on the third floor, while xray\'s are taken on the second floor, so patients are reminded to arrive 20 minutes early.For those proactive patients researching their care:For hip joint preserving procedures such as treating FAIlabral tears, Dr Mast prefers open dislocation to arthroscopy, as this was in which he trainedDue to concerns about metal ions, rarely performs Birmingham hip resurfacing, reserving it for younger male patientsMuch prefers the anterior approach for total hip replacementsNote his office clinic days are Mondays and Thursday mornings as of writing.'),(2718,257,5,'I Went In to see Dr. Mast after suffering from back and hip pain, I had had a previous posterior double hip replacement in 1999 at UCSF, I tried to get an appointment with my former surgeon there but he was retiring from the hospital, So I checked YELP reviews and tried Dr. Mast. The office is professional and you will likely be seen in a timely manner, The staff is caring and organized. Dr. Mast advised me to get an anterior double hip revision as the old parts had worn out, I signed up that day and had surgery 5 weeks later. I am 6 weeks post op today so I had an Xray and met with Dr. Mast, I am doing great! Back to the gym, walking, short hikes and minimal scaring. The xray tech, office staff and nurses as well as Kathleen Lew, P.A. make a perfect team for this excellent surgeon. Seeing him was one of my better decisions.'),(2719,257,5,'Dr. Mast and his team are the best. Professional, courteous, and attentive. When I started researching hip replacement surgeons, I saw several that were ready to cut, but who I didn\'t feel comfortable being in the same room as their egos. Then I was directed to Dr. Mast. My first meeting with him was a breathy of fresh air. He explained the different approaches, the longevity ratings of each, and his experiences of the +s and s of each. He treated me as an adult, instead of his next slab to cut. The surgery and care after was fantastic. His professionalism carried through all of the people that were part of my surgery team. Each person checked in at different times. All showed the same patience and care that I\'d had the first time with Dr. Mast. As for recovery, mine matched that of many who have Yelped Dr. Mast. Walking the day after surgery, going up the stairs the second day. I actually only used a cane for 1  2 days after that, so by the 4th day, no cane and no crutches. Still slow and a bit sore, but the body was working again. Now, 8 weeks after surgery, I can put my palms flat on the floor when I bend to touch the floor without bending my knees; I can walk 3  4 miles without pain, and I am riding my bike back and forth to work again only 3 miles each way, but up and down hills each way. And my pain meds are down usually to an Alleve and Tylenol once per day. I hope to be completely off them in 1  2 more weeks. Oh, and with Dr. Mast\'s anterior approach, there are no range of motion restictions at all, from the very beginning. This means that you can start exercising to get your body fully functional right away, which means less scar tissue to build up, which means better and faster recovery. A couple of other good things to know:* Kathleen, Dr. Mast\'s P.A., is great. Humor, kindness, intelligence. And knows her stuff, as do the rest of the team. * At St. Francis Memorial Hospital, you get a private room for recovery. Doesn\'t sound like a big deal, but it was very nice to have. If I ever need to have a hip replacement again, or if anyone asks me my thoughts on my surgery, I would recommend Dr. Mast and his team fully!'),(2720,257,5,'I was very pleased and grateful to have recently had a full hip replacement under the care of Dr. Mast. His bedside manner was excellent. When I first went to discuss the potential surgery, he spent more than 30 minutes with me, just talking about his practice and answering my questions. He did not speak condescendingly with an inflated ego, but was warm and responsive. He also suggested I try more medication first to see if we could postpone the surgery That didn\'t work, but I was heartened that he wasn\'t pushing me into surgery. All of the care workers at St. Francis told me that he was a special surgeon. The surgery went well and after almost three weeks, I\'m heading back to work tomorrow. I left the hospital after one night with only a cane and this past weekend, I hiked up in the hills of Marin for an hour and a half. Still some soreness, but pretty amazing after such a short time. Also, his physician assistant, Kathleen Lew, is delightful, efficient and responsive. The food at St. Francis, was surprisingly good and the care there was also superlative. All in all, a really good experience in a trying situation.'),(2721,257,4,'Dr. Mast did an excellent job on my anterior hip replacement. Surgery itself was relatively quick and recovery in hospital was easy. The incision is only 3 inches long and very clean. Was walking with crutches and doing exercises the day of surgery, then went home the next day. Not much pain or discomfort and could slowly climb stairs with one crutch first day home. Mainly rested for several days, but did prescribed exercises. Did not require crutches after a few days but often used one just for protection. Recovery was even better than the high expectation that I had.24 days after surgery and unrelated to completing my first two rehab sessions, I had an unfortunate setback when standing up from a sitting position on the floor after working on a furnace repair. Things were going so well, I was giving little thought to limitations from the hip implant. As I extended my surgical leg to stand, I felt and heard something in my upper leg tear in two stages while the leg buckled back and forth. Subsequently the quadriceps turned black and blue and though not really painful, the upper thigh and side of the hip were swollen, stiff, and sore. Went in to see Dr. Mast for Xrays 5 days later to ensure the implant was still correctly in place. The hip implant was shown to be solid and still in excellent position. Guess that shows the durability of the hip implant. Dr. Mast said it may have been stitches tearing out around the hip capsule and I am sure there was a contusion in the quadriceps as well, so perhaps two back to back events. Took it easy for about 23 weeks and gradually began exercising and taking longer walks. Things went well and I did further rehab on my own.The new hip is now performing admirably 80 days after surgery and I don\'t think about it much at all. Seems like a normal hip though still not fully flexible without help in bending leg across opposite knee and slightly stiff when standing after being seated for some time. I rate the overall procedure and Dr. Mast\'s surgery skills as 5 stars. The anterior hip surgery is the ONLY way to go and with his experience and capabilities he is to be highly recommended. Dr. Mast is quite talented, proficient, and does excellent work.My overall rating of only a 4 has to do with: 1 limited time with Dr. Mast except for the initial investigative and explanatory visit, 2 long delay getting into surgery due to a mixup in hospital scheduling of the operating room, 3 a wrongly scheduled appointment that led me to go to SF only to find that he was not in office on my scheduled appointment day, 4 routine long waits in his office, 5 my injury during recuperation, and 6 on one visit having 5 unnecessary Xrays because the operator was not positioning my hip correctly; after Dr. Mast saw the poor Xrays, I had to go across the street to St. Francis Hospital and have the normal 2 front and side hip Xrays taken again 7 in total that day.In summary, I am quite pleased by the overall results and would highly recommend Dr. Mast. He has had great training in the anterior approach, is quite experienced with an excellent record in both quantity and quality, and is a skilled surgeon. I am quite pleased with the overall results.'),(2722,257,5,'Had my hip done by Dr Mast about 1 month ago. Used crutches for one day. Used a cane for about 1 week.

Dr Mast is kind, professional and extremely patient. I brought pages of questions with me to my first meeting with Dr Mast, he answered every single one and never made me feel like I was wasting his time.When I was being wheeling into the St Francis operating room for my surgery, the surgery room assistant pushing my gurney asked how I had found out about Dr Mast. The assistant told me that he had worked at St Francis for 20 years and assisted many hip surgeons. He said that he had never seen a surgeon so technically skilled as Dr Mast. And, he was amazed at the results produced by using the Anterior approach no muscles are cut for quicker recovery time, less pain and almost no risk of dislocation.Maybe this assistant offers similar words of preop encouragement to all patients regardless of who the surgeon is.

Geoffrey knew of the processes to certify and seal the documentation.Overall I was very satisfied with my experience in this capacity and their in depth knowledge of this part of the immigration process gave me peace of mind to me when I was dreading looking for ways to best get this sorted.Thank you.'),(2746,259,5,'I went there to see Dr. Abramson for the civil surgeon.Usually the hospital wants to give you as many shot as possible because it gives them lots of green,Dr. Abramson looked through my previous records, and said that since I am twentyyearold, I do not need any shot !Well I had to test my blood though, it was not bad experience,actually it was the best experience in my life! Dr. Abramson was very friendly, translating all those crazy terms into understandable vocabulary.I pay $ 395 for civil surgeon check and for one copy of the document, one sealed document to send the government.I would like to visit again, if I have to see a doctor. :'),(2747,259,5,'To echo the other 5star reviews, the doctor and his staff have been extremely helpful to me with a variety of my issues. Despite having a busy practice, I\'m almost always able to schedule an appt. within a few days of my calling and receive a response to my email or phone questions often the same day. I\'ve consulted many MDs in my life, and it\'s rare I\'ve found one as knowledgalble, accommodating, and concerned as Dr. Abramson.MIchael R. Edelstein  ThreeMinuteTherapy.com'),(2748,259,1,'Ok, I\'m a very straight forward person which many people cannot handle, but it is what it is. I found Dr. Abramson through a Google search. I was looking for a doctor close to my home location. He provided me with what I needed and was generally easy to speak to. His services in my mind were very average. He tries to put forth a cutting edge type attitude, but other than having a new office and Mac computers, there is nothing cutting edge going on here. What turned my experience sour was that he started upselling additional services to increase his income. This is fine when selling cars and used car parts, but we are talking about human beings and their money and feelings. He has a woman that works for him and her name is Stonna. First off, she was very, very pushy when she called me regarding taking a CIMT, which I really didn\'t need. I\'ve already consulted with another doctor regarding my blood test results and the necessity of a CIMT screening. Anyways, back to Stonna. I\'m not sure if she is a doctor or an office assistant, but she is very pushy with selling the services over the phone. I had to cancel my CIMT screening, because of an important deadline. It was the 1st time since I\'ve been with this office that I had to cancel. Stonna called me back after I left a message stating I couldn\'t make it. She would not take no for an answer. It was really irritating to say the least. I asked her for a one time break because she said she\'d have to charge me $95 for not showing up. It would have been fine if the conversation ended there, but she keep bugging me while I\'m driving and talking. She was taking it very personnal and kept asking me, why can\'t you make it, Why, why, why? I explained over and over again. I told her that she was really disturbing me with the way she was selling this heart test and it was not used car parts. I began to think that maybe she\'s getting a kickback or commission on the Up Sells. Why would she go to such extreme? Why wouldn\'t she just take my excuse and move on? Anyways, I got hot, irritated and called her the B word. She hung up on me.So I get a call back later in the afternoon and it was Geoffrey. I stated to him that I didn\'t like the way I was treated by Stonna and I would have said what I did if it happened again. I did not regret it. I told him that Stonna was very unprofessional, uncaring and obviously cared about the MONEY only. I told Geoffrey that I would prefer to find another doctor if this is the way they operated. Funny, in response to that, Geoffrey stated that they had a zero tolerance policy regarding swearing and that I was terminated as a patient. I had to laugh to myself. Is Bitch a swear word? I guess in their book. He said his orders to call me came from the top. So why didn\'t the TOP call me? So now, I have lost all respect for Dr. Abramson as a Doctor and person. He did not have Balls enough to call and discuss this with me in person. Instead he put poor little Geoffrey up to the task. How unprofessional can you get? I don\'t mind being outed for calling Stonna the B word, but at least be man enough to speak to me directly. My take is that there\'s a lot of upselling going on here. This was the 2nd time I was offered additional services. I understand this is a business, I\'m a business owner myself, but as a doctor you are dealing with human beings, their bodies and sensitive issues regarding their bodies. PLEASE quit operating like a used car part store and have a little more compassion and sensitivity to a patient\'s needs and wallet. The health care system is in enough of a mess. Let\'s not make it more expensive because the office rent is too high.Ken Mierzwinski'),(2749,259,5,'I went to see Dr. Abramson for my green card medical examination as he is a civil surgeon and my health care network didn\'t have one.I picked him based on his very good reviews on yelp and I can now add another one to the list.He knew very well the process I needed his help for, especially which tests to runs and which records I needed to have. He was very good dealing with the troubles of the TB vaccination for example. His pricing was very clear, from the beginning, even if a little bit higher than the standard fee I could see at other places.Last, when it turned out that I needed some vaccinations he offered me to get them through my health care provider which didn\'t charge me for them rather than through him at a cost of $90 each.

The surgery isn\'t cheap and I am still deciding whether to go through with it, but the good news is that Dr. Fan offers free consultations.

Once I was done I was then greeted by Stephanie who did my Cool Sculpting consult and she was AMAZING she was very knowledgeable, answered all of my questions and explained step by step what I was going to experience.

I was very upset and then I found Dr. Brill. He took time to listen to me, advised me he would have a thorough look around before he did anything and when I woke from surgery he told me that the tube was not blocked as the fertility doctor had suspected and that he had not had to remove the tube and I was at full fertility.

His bedside manner is unparalleled, as well as that of his team, Angela and Anita. They go over the procedure in great detail. Being a healthcare professional, I appreciated it all the more. They show you what will be done, what to expect and what the recovery will be like.And speaking of recovery, mine was unbelievable. The day I got discharged, I rested at home. The next day I went on a few short walks in my neighborhood and gradually increased my walking to several miles. But I still took it easy and made sure that I slept and ate really well. I had no pain whatsoever. Didn\'t need to take any NSAID\'s or pain meds.

He\'s an evil to female patient, please take my advice and don\'t even bother to call for appointment because only disappointment upon for sure!!!If you do plan to visit him then keep in mind that he will invite 2 female assistants inside the room when he physically examines you although he sees your painful expression and he would still proceeded nonstoppingly.

Not money oriented and with basic medical ethics. A dignity to doctor world.Dr Linda Giudice at UCSF Center for Reproductive Health also said it\'s ok to have baby with the existence of ovarian cyst. My tips to female health with chronic disease of Endometriosis are shop around and talk with experts, not just surgeon! Bear in mind that a long wait to see a specialist is worth the time. Reproductive Endocrinologist is much more important for taking hormonal therapy or choosing infertility treatment.'),(2798,261,5,'Dr. Brill & his staff are all extremely professional, yet approachable. He is confident, but not cocky.

I told him I wanted only the fibroid tumor removed if there was no imminent danger or issues with leaving my uterus and cervix in tact. He suggested additional testing MRI and blood work to ensure there were no other issues and get comfort with proceeding as I desired. The entire experience endtoend was one of the best experiences I\'ve had with a doctor and their team. Dr. Brill and his team got to know me and made me feel incredibly comfortable with the procedure. He went above and beyond by coming by and talking before surgery, walking me into surgery and the post opp followup was unbelievable. Two calls a day one from his team and one from Dr Brill for three days after surgery. I was up in a day walking and back at work a week later. Four weeks I was able to do everything including Pilates, etc. It\'s been six weeks and I can barely see the scars.

Just gives you all the information you need to make an informed decision.

Amazed at how well post op has gone. Had the procedure on Monday morning and went home early Monday afternoon. Up and around doing stair climbing on Tuesday. Took a long walk on Wednesday. Started tapering the pain meds and went out to lunch on Thursday. Staff is really attentive and makes you feel instantly at home. Alicia, Anita, and Angela are right there when you need them.

I seriously needed a good GYN surgeon. Two years prior I had my kidney removed  so medical mishaps were not an option. I had already consulted with two surgeons and one of them told me NO DOCTOR could remove my fibroids with laparoscopic surgery. Unconvinced, I searched the Internet, found Dr. Brill, and knew I was onto something great.During my first consultation I was hoping I could avoid surgery all together  even though I carried around a palpable bulk in my stomach. However, when I met with Dr. Brill again to review the MRI it was clear, with 14 fibroids, that I needed surgery.When the day came I arrived at CPMC at 7:30 a.m. and the staff made me comfortable. Dr. Brill then calmed my nerves and my families\'. Then I met Anesthesiologist Dr. Heidi Witherall. I was concerned because after my kidney surgery I had unbearable thirst for months. She addressed the concern before I mentioned it. Dr. Brill then put his arm around my shoulder and we walked into the surgery room together. In the operating room, as I was preparing to lay down, he asked me who my favorite singer was and then put Adele on Pandora.During surgery Dr. Brill discovered that some fibroids had calcified.  It took four hours, expert skill, and incredible patience to break down the bonelike calcifications and pull them through a 2cm incision. A few hours after surgery I was ready to go home and would have walked to the car myself but hospital policy required a wheelchair.Two days after surgery I met a good friend for dinner and went to an art gallery. A few days after that I went on a twomile walk, met more friends, as if nothing had happened. My only minor setback was when I ate spicy food too soon  something I was warned not to do.Less than six weeks have passed since the surgery and life is completely back to normal! Better than normal  since two pounds of fibroids have been removed  I have my waste back and much more energy. Dr. Brill and his Dream Team are genius!'),(2806,261,5,'I traveled from WA to do surgery with Dr. Brill for two reasons: one, my primary doctor recommended him and two, more important than anything, Dr. Brill called me to give me a second opinion even though his staff told me that he doesn\'t do it over the phone they couldn\'t bill insurance for phone consultation. He told me that he just likes to help. I knew right there and then I was dealing with an extraordinary man. But even that didn\'t prepare me for what I experienced after meeting Dr. Brill. His knowledge and expertise are unquestionable..... but what sets him apart from all the other doctors surgeons in particular is his generous and genuine care for his patients topped with a healthy dose of positive attitude, humor and lightheart. I felt like I was his family member and therefor got a special treatment. But if you read other reviews, he is like that with all his patients. Dr. Brill\'s presence alone makes you heal 10 times faster than any pain killers, time and chicken soup for the soul. He is a true healer who tends to your body, mind and soul  a gift one is born with and cannot be acquired! In the end, my uterus was saved even though a surgeon in WA told me to completely take it out and start looking for a surrogate mother for my future child.

He and his staff are awesome. After years of suffering and constant disbelief from other medical professionals he was a breath of fresh air. He gave me his surgical recommendation and said he would ultimately perform the surgery I wanted. It was all covered by health insurance which his office organized. Amazing that I walked out of the hospital the same day and semi back to normal the next. Incredible.

Mine didn\'t shrink much so they were 56 cm big and at bad locations. My Kaiser doctor which I also adore very much can only do an open operation and will require 46 weeks of recovery time, so i reached out for help. I got referred to Dr. Brill by a family member who also works at CPMC, and I\'m so so glad I asked for referral.We had an insurance problem to begin with, as I have double insurance and CPMC is under my 2nd coverage, but Alicia and Dr. Brill spent hours and days to help me to resolve that issue.When the day came I arrived at CPMC at 2pm.Hospital staff was very friendly and checked me in, Angela came to check on me in the waiting room and made sure everything was ok. Then Dr. Brill walked me into the surgery room and asked me what kind of music i like to listen. I was out before I can even worry about anything, or enjoy the music ;When I woke up it was 6pm, and saw my husband\'s smily face, and i was told surgery was very successful.I planned to go home after couple hours, but I was too dizzy to walk, so I requested to stay at the hospital overnight, which I\'m glad I did. First night was not comfortable  no pain just discomfort from general anesthesia, but after few hours of sleep and when i woke up next morning, I was good to walk. Anita, Angela and Dr. Brill called me few times during first 3 days to check. The most amazing was I didn\'t have any pain at all. After the surgery, I took pain killer every few hours as directed for the first night, and I took two pills for next morning, that\'s it.I started doing light exercise after 1st week, and biked for 10 miles after 1st month! It took couple weeks for most stitches to come off naturally, and 4 weeks for stitches around belly button to fall. At week 3, my belly button had tiny blood for few minutes, I called in and Anita told me it was normal.I used to have heavy periods, now it\'s been 3 months after my surgery, my period is no longer as heavy as it used to, wohoo, and I can actually do stuff on my first day!;If anyone is looking to have fibroids removed with a minimally invasive procedure, I would highly recommend Dr. Brill and his team.'),(2809,261,5,'Sorry for the loooong review but I can\'t help it!!! Dr. Brill is a magician. He and his staff Anita, Angela and Alicia make you feel very important and cared for. I saw several doctors for my situation but they are the best. I saw him in Nov 2012 for fibroids and ovarian cysts. My surgery got postponed a couple of times because my blood count was messed up. Then I had to go to the emergency where Dr.Bill was not a doc due to tuboovarian abscess. I was in the hospital not CPMC for a week and I had several doctors attending me. Dr. Brill and Anita were very helpful and accessible the whole time. Anita called me twice to check on me when I was in hospital. After I was back from the hospital Dr.Brill postponed my surgery yet again for a month. He said because I had an abscess drained its better if I wait for the surgery. I have to admit that I was kind of irritated at that point but Oh boy I am so glad I listened to him and chose him as my Doctor. My case was quite complicated, Dr. Brill himself had told me that in a 110 scale my case was 24. My surgery was finally was done in early 2013 and was a total success. He took out all the fibroids 67, endometriosis and big cysts on both of my ovaries. I had a dilated fallopian tube where I had an abscess before, he said that was healed and looked normal and didn\'t need any alteration, so waiting for surgery was a spot on move.On the surgery day he walked me to the operation room, introduced everybody nurse, attending doctors etc and assured me that I am going to be fine. And he was absolutely right. My recovery was quick and very smooth. I didn\'t bleed much after surgery, just a little spotting for a couple of days may be too much info but I was afraid of this so much Dr. Brill called me twice after surgery and so did Anita. Anita was my go to person in the whole process. She is warm, comforting, very approachable and a wonderful person. Dr. Brill is great but because of his staff especially Anita, we had absolute zero stress regarding the procedure. I knew she was available to answer any of my smallest and stupidest questions.I totally recommended Dr. Brill and his staff. They are great people with brilliant professional expertise. I consulted with quiet a few doctors for my problem and they all suggested open surgery for my case as it was very complicated. Dr. Brill was the only one who was confident about doing it laparoscopically. I live in the South Bay and used to drive 60 miles one way to see him, but that was nothing compared to the result. Dr.Brill\'s office was very accommodating especially since I used to come from so far, they combined couple of appointments together for my convenience.My only complain is CPMC nurses kicked me out of the hospital before I could see Dr.Brill and receive reports of my surgery. He did come to meet me but that time I was not feeling well so he said he will come later but I didn\'t get a time to see him. So just don\'t tell the CPMC nurses that you are feeling good before seeing Dr. Bill otherwise they will kick you out.'),(2810,261,5,'Great surgeon!

I have a physically demanding job, and I was unable to return to work after 4 weeks and they basically said you tell us what you need. These people encourage and supportgasp!a woman listening to her body and getting what she needs to function well.An added bonus for me, because I love this stuff, were the several color photographs I got of the inside of my body before, during, and after surgery.

No, there are more subtle and sophisticated approaches, Dr Brill.

A hysterectomy should only be performed in most extreme cases, so that women may keep their natural organs and...be women!I was completely shocked by this Dr\'s solution to endo, in this 21 st century of adavanced medical technology...please do your homework and get SEVERAL opinions from specialists.

Dr. Jordan Horowitz treated my bartholin\'s cyst during the same surgery. What worked for me:1. Organization:  Attention to detail was great. All appointments, scheduling, paperwork, coordination, prescriptions, and followup etc. were impeccable. 2. Treatment: Pre, during and post op were well handled. All questions were answered and the entire time I felt as a patient I was in control of what was going on and happening to me. Dr. Brill personally called me twice during the course of my treatment, and his nurses also checked in several times. After my surgery, I had healed perfectly and the entire procedure was flawless. Granted, I followed Dr. Brill\'s instructions to the T, he gave the right direction to make my operation and recovery easy on me. On my last follow up visit with Dr. Brill, the excitement Dr. Brill had for his job well done was proof positive that I picked the right guy with the right team for the job. He is the type of surgeon who gets excited about doing things right, and his staff is onboard with that program.In response to a review by Amy T one star review she mentions unwanted neck massages by Dr. Brill. She made it sound like he was doing something inappropriate andor illtimed. He also touched me on the neckshoulder when I was in his office. But it was meant to be a normal human connection while he and his nurses were talking to me about a range of things associated with my visits. I didn\'t find it strange at all. It\'s clear his intent is to connect on a human level and reduce stress for patients. Let\'s be honest, if you\'re seeing Dr. Brill he\'s going to be touching a lot more than your shoulder, and potentially being responsible for you in a big way if you choose him to perform surgery. So a hand on the shoulder isn\'t a big deal.Dr. Brill has a personality and we all know not all people mesh with each other, which is fine. However, it\'s clear his intent comes from a caring, professional, human place. I really liked that about him and his staff.'),(2814,261,5,'Dr. Brill and his team are fantastic!

And for the record I am VERY pain tolerant...2 weeks later I never received that phone call and I cannot handle the pain anymore it\'s an 89 now. It tells me the cyst is bigger, and things might have gotten more serious now and that I might now need a cystectomy as opposed to a laparoscopy which is a much more traumatic procedure underwent it 10 months ago I don\'t care how good you are, if you cannot see people in pain in a timely manner you will not be my doctor...'),(2816,261,5,'Could not have had a better experience!

After my first appointment, I knew I was in capable hands. I was confident that if any doctor could perform this surgery successfully, it would be Dr. Brill. I had a laparoscopic partial hysterectomy eight weeks ago and feel fantastic. Dr. Brill successfully removed my mass of fibroids which weighed in at almost five pounds! I was his largest case to date and the largest case in San Francisco to be removed laparoscopically. I had the surgery in the morning and was home that evening. There is no doubt had I been in the hands of a less skilled surgeon, I would have had a completely different outcome.I\'m an extreme case, so I hope it\'s encouraging for women to know they have less invasive options even at an advanced stage. I feel better than I\'ve felt in years and I owe it all to Dr. Brill and his team!'),(2822,261,5,'have had two surgeries with dr. brill. both easy and successful. he was profession as was his staff. loved working with him. chicago\'s loss is our gain.'),(2823,261,5,'I found Dr. Brill from the website of California Pacific Medical Group.

The first meeting was 1 month ago, he checked body and also carefully read all my record, he also show me all the pictures and told me he WILL NOT REMOVE MY OVARY, not 100% sure but I can see the confidence in his eyes.His staff are very awesome and very friendly, like his assistant and nurse Angela. When I talked him, he made me feel I have known him for years. We chatted a little bit about my life and my business, he made me totally relaxed.As such a popular surgeon who had been in business for more than 20 years, he looks incrediably young and engertic. Today, 25th of January, I had my surgery in CPMG at 12am, I arrived 10:30. Surprisely I met Dr. Andreww Brill, he came in and spent time talked almost everything and he made me feel totally relaxed. I had a huge CYST as big as an organge. I have read so many women \'s failed stories, most of them, got ovary removed. Do not mention he showed the operation room, his warm hand always calm me down.2 hours later, I woke up in the recovery room, I saw him right away, he told me that my ovary still there, surgery is very successful! He had five small holes on my stomach.2 hours later, I moved to rest area, he came in and checked me again, make sure I have no discharge and everything OK.Now is 9:30pm , I had dinner and relaxing in my bed surfing on the internet, I just want to write a review to share my experience, I had an awesome experirence, I have no pain at all and feel like a normal person.I will see him in 2 weeks, I will write a review afterward keep everything posted my progress.As a healthy person, you might not care about the surgery experinece, I have abeen a healthy one for 36 years as a woman, I just can recall when I was diagnosed the ovary cyst, how desperate I was and after read many woman\'s bad experience, I just know lucky I am, as I was in a good hand.'),(2824,261,1,'Just an update.

I never expected to laugh through the exams, or to feel as safe and warm going into surgery as if my own family were watching out for me. They don\'t just have a positive, upbeat attitude themselves, but they help you to have one, even if before you came to see them, you were used to getting bad news. I think the key is that he believes wholeheartedly that everything will be fine, and then it is.

I called My ob and my general doctor. Went to ER with 103 temp and swollen red hot stomach. I got antibiotics and the next day my incision wound started to drain the grossest fluid. Went back to ER. Dr. Green was great. Dr. Brill still did not return any calls. He had Angela call me. After second round of antibiotics and two weeks still draining fluid, Dr. Green said to get in touch with Brill because he needed to help. Anita called and said come in, but he\'s not there. Dr. Green said she just talked to him and he is there. I went in and Dr. Brill said he needed to see the drainage because there wasn\'t any there. I said it was on the gauze that Anita just threw out. He didn\'t believe me. Now, five weeks post op and I have this crazy blister with fluid in it. I called Dr. Brill\'s office and no call back.

You all are the BEST!'),(2829,261,5,'I have been dealing with dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, fibroids and polycystic ovary syndrome since puberty. I have had various treatments for my condition, that also included a previous open surgery  however, for the past ten years or so, every gyn that I have seen has recommended hysterectomy. While I was not opposed to having the surgery because my quality of life was severely and increasingly affected, I just could not believe in this time of technology advances that I was left with the singular option of having an open surgery, a 3  4 day hospital stay, a bikini cutscar, and 6  10 weeks of major recovery time off work.After years and years of research, I found the Center for Advanced Options in Gynecological Surgery located at California Pacific Medical Center headed by Director, Dr. Andrew Brill. Dr. Brill specializes in minimally invasive gynecological surgery using laparascopic techniques. Using this technology, the surgery is performed on an outpatient basis, the healing time is cut in less than half 2  3 weeks, the surgery is less traumatic and the results more esthetically pleasing as you have minimal incisions and minimal scarring afterwards. I also personally found that the thought of having minimally invasive vs an open surgery was better for my emotional and mental health. After years of pain and discomfort, with one visit to Dr. Brill, I was sold  this is what I had spent years looking for to address my gynecological problems.  Dr. Brill is highly skilled, very personable, has a terrific bedside manner, a great sense of humor, is totally and truly dedicated to women\'s health issues and to minimally invasive surgical techniques. My surgery turned out to be very complex, and I could not have been entrusted to better surgical hands than Dr. Brill\'s!  Dr. Brill and his staff are very professional, caring, supportive, responsive and concerned. They explain every aspect of your medical condition, treatment plan and even the most remote, but possible complications very thorughly. They remain available to answer questions at any time from the time of initial consultation through recovery, and beyond. Dr. Brill and his staff all seem to have a true calling for the work they do. I could not be happier with my decision to become a patient of Dr. Brill\'s practice, or the results of my surgery. I feel as if they have given me my life back. I had experienced a tremedous amount of pain and discomfort in the past, but never truly understood how sick I was until after the surgery. Though healing, almost immediately after the surgery I felt 100% better! If I had to do it all over again I would take the same path  and go through years of pain  if that path eventually led to Dr. Brill!So ladies  do your homework. For any GYN issues, if your MD says you need surgery  do yourself a favor and consult with Dr. Brill. I think you will be very glad you did. It was certainly worth waiting for in my case!PS to other GYNs  Shame on you!!! I went through years and years of pain, and you never suggested laparascopicminimally invasive surgery to me even though I repeatedly discussed my desire to address my GYN issues without having an open surgery!

Yet, my OBGYN was adamant that it should come out before it becomes symptomatic and referred to me a couple of laparascopic surgeons. The first referral did not work out for me, as I was not comfortable both with the doctor and his office stuff. After making an appointment with Dr. Brill, my experience has been only positive each step of the way. His assistant, Anita Anderson, RN, who conducted the first phone interview with me and then managed my case up until the surgery, is very warm, kind, caring and thorough. Dr. Brill impressed me as a surgeon at the top of his profession, who genuinely cares about his patients and gives a good amount of thought to your particular case. He takes the time to explain the procedure, as well as the steps leading to it and possible complications. He is smart, direct and very thorough.

And, I\'m not some young chick...I\'m 61. The procedure is done laparoscopically. All I had were three tiny incisions and some stitches in my navel and they are all but invisible now 8 weeks later. I still hear stories about women who are still being carved open and suffer for weeks afterward because their surgeon doesn\'t know this procedure and it\'s so unnessary when there are doctors like Dr. Brill who can do a complete hysterectomy that incurs minimal down time and discomfort.

I owe this review not only to Dr. Brill and his wonderful team, but also to many women in and out of state considering myomectomy and trying to decide on the physician.In short  this is one of the best experiences with doctors I have ever had. The right way of describing Dr. Brill\'s practice would be to give two distinct reviews about him and his team, but they really operate so smoothly and so professionally together that it is hard to separate those two entities. Before going to Dr. Brill I did my homework and found out that he is truly a key opinion leader in the field and very well sought after by both his colleagues and industry. He lived up to all those expectations and more.Personally  he has an outstanding clinical judgment and personal skills, makes one feel incredibly comfortable and at ease even when discussing notsocomfortable issues. After examining, Dr. Brill and his team sat down with me, draw a picture of the condition and described how they would fix the problem: concise and with realistic expectations. An important details  Dr. Brill was also very conscious about the insurance plan I had.Then the team Anita and Angie walked me through the prep procedures and completely surrounded me with the care. They were incredibly warm, responsive and helpful in getting answers to virtually any questions. Despite quite complex pathology, surgery results were outstanding. Postop care, the level of the involvement and the follow up was truly remarkable  as a patient you feel that this physician really cares about you. You can\'t beat that! I am glad I chose Dr. Brill over another luminary at Stanford. If you are one of those women with fibroids and face dilemma of choosing a right doctor for your surgery  go to Andrew Brill. I would recommend him in a heart beat!P.S. He looks like Larry David, incredibly charming and is also a lot of fun. Talking to him makes one forget the reason why you ended up in the hospital.'),(2835,263,5,'Dr. Yin is very through, polite, and conscientious. He is helping me get my diabetes under control.

Sixplus months to schedule a appointment for a longterm patient, furthermore one with some rather worrisome issues?Maybe I got lucky. I have had the feeling for a couple of years now that I was just another insurance billing to be cranked through the Sutter system as quickly as possible. Since I last saw him, another doctor discovered quite serious side effects associated with the meds Dr. Yin had prescribed. Although I described the disturbing symptoms to him a year ago, he made no mention that they might be caused by the drugs he was prescribing. Doing my own research, I find that the side effects which have made my life miserable are actually extremely common with the drugs Yin was prescribing. He definitely should have:1. Warned me of the possible ill consequences2. Acted when I described the symptoms causing me accute distressDr. Yin did neither.So all things considered, perhaps this is a useful wakeup call. I\'d had the feeling he wasn\'t really paying attention anymore, or doing much of anything actually, and turns out I was right. He had also referred me to another physician who was laughably incompetent.I see others here have also remarked on the overbooking.

He was worth the wait.    Yes, it is a long wait to get an appointment, true, but I don\'t blame him for that. He is a fantastic doctor, who is clearly super bright, compassionate, empathic, and patient. I am an anxious person, so going to see a doctor who is this way, truly makes a difference for me in how I feel about my health care, and that I am in good hands.  I had a biopsy last year in his office, which although it hurt quite a bit, he did his best to make it tolerable for me and apologized the whole time for it hurting so much. What other doctor does that?    Yesterday, I went in for a thyroid scan, which was after a year had gone by, and it went well. He was training a young woman doctor, which he also had done during a prior visit. I agreed to let her be in the room each time. He is a great instructor for the new doctors, patient and informative, just like he is with his patients.     I don\'t have to go in for three years now  but I will miss seeing him, because he is just so nice to talk with and I do feel lucky to have him as my endocrinologist.

I was diagnosed with a nodule on my right side of my thyroid, which after two very painful biopsies, I was recommended for surgery by Dr. Yin.  I then went to my surgeon, who did a fantastic job, and overall has been the only person I have seen for a followup. Why would I only go to the surgeon for a followup? Mostly because Dr. Yin\'s office is now too busy to get me in for a followup, and prefers that I email him.  So, do the best to understand where I am coming from I have had half of a vital organ that controls several parts of your overall daily function, removed.  But yet, my doctor who sent me for this surgery, can only be reached by email? I am also told that it is a 5 month waiting time frame before I can get in was told this on two different occasions?? What the? Needless to say from my primary care physicians down to the specialists who have been seeing me from a slew of issues that have occurred over the last year, I am switching physicians. I wish Dr. Yin the best with his practice, but he shouldn\'t have bitten off more than he can chew by accepting too many patients.

I particularly like how responsive he is to electronic messaging on Sutter My Health Online website. I usually get a response within a few hours of my inquiries. I would recommend Dr Yin to anyone looking for a caring competent Endocrinologist. My only complaint is that he works in Novato only 1 day per week. I know you can\'t fault a physician for being so busy, but I wish he could devote a little more time to the Novato office as he is one of the very few Endocrinologists that my medical insurance covers.'),(2845,263,5,'My experience with Dr Yin and his office was top notch. Dr Yin addressed my concerns, was thorough and a good listener. He referred me out to another professional when it was appropriate and took the time to send me a letter with names and phone #s. I never felt rushed and always felt like I was important. From the receptionist to the phlebotomist to the doctor this office is what health care should be a place where you feel taken care of.'),(2846,263,1,'My appointment with Dr. Yin was good, he took the time to get to know me as a patient and understand my condition. Netnet, though, he did what every other endocrinologist I\'ve ever had does  take a look at the blood work, and make a decision about whether to move my synthroid medication one dose up the scale or keep it the same. Pretty basic hypothyroidism decision making, something my general practitioner or gynecologist has had no problem doing in the past. I was a specialist this time only because my new gynecologist wanted me to see someone more familiar with the drug and my general practitioner...that\'s a story for another review, but basically I felt I should at least be seing a real medical professional for this prescription. Unfortunately, all that time Dr. Yin took asking me basic questions was padding for my bill. If I could redo the experience, I would have questioned the need for the doctor to spend any more than 15 minutes with me, and lesson learned, I will always keep a stopwatch with me for future appointments. When I got the bill in the mail, total $542, my portion $238.70 obviously my insurance decided this was pretty ridiculous too and passed a good portion of the cost to me I called in expecting this to have been some sort of clerical mistake. I called in on 4 separate occasions, taking time away from my 1014 hour workday to take care of this since no one ever called me back  very professional Sutter! Each time I was told me appointment was under review for proper coding and I would be notified when a decision was made. I was also told I shouldn\'t pay the bill, and that these bills never went to collections. Fortunately, I didn\'t believe that and I eventually did pay the bill because I don\'t see why my credit report should suffer because this billing department can\'t get their act together. Unfortunately, my account still got sent to collections! When I checked my account, I received the collections letter a full two weeks after my check was cashed. I called for the final time today, and they said the coding decision came back and that my appointment apparently lasted for 60 minutes! In one of my previous calls the claim was 35 minutes. Besides being untrue, what doctor would ever spend 60 minutes with a healthy 25yearold woman who simply needs a slightly higher dose on synthroid? If, when I was booking the appointment, someone had told me they wanted the doctor to spend an hour with me and it was going to cost 4 times a normal appointment accordingly, do you think I would have ever gone? Absolutely not. I continue to be absolutely shocked by the medical profession. As a consultant, I\'m in the service industry and there is not such thing as sending a humungous bill for services already rendered and just saying, Oh you disagree? Well after only 3 months of thinking about it our coding department says this is right, so too bad. Also, in previous cities where I have had this same appointment, including Barnes Jewish hospital in St. Louis one of the top in the nation this type of appointment has run me closer to $100$150 before the insurance is applied. Seriously, suddenly it\'s $542? If I had gotten a normal bill, my review for Dr. Yin would have been 4 or 5 stars, but it wasn\'t a normal bill. I would like to see doctors taking some responsibility for what happens to their patients as part of their overall experience, not just what their blood work looks like next time. What I learned from this experience: Avoid Sutter at all cost Ask for an estimate for any medical appointment before going  Bring a stopwatch to appointments and walk out after 15 Stalk the billing department  you cannot assume after asking them 4 times to call you back that they will call you back Don\'t go to the doctor, even when you need to'),(2847,263,5,'Dr Anthony Yin is a great doctor  caring and highly competent.

Dr Yin was wonderful, he was super informative, he listened to all my rambling and fears and he was so nice to me.

I would highly recommend Dr. Barnett, he is wonderful at what he does and I can see the passion he has in his work. With no doubt in my mind this is the Surgeon I will be going to for any future procedures! Thank you Dr. Barnett.'),(2854,264,5,'My daughter did extensive research and met with several plastic surgeons. After meeting Dr. Barnett she knew he was the very best choice. She had her surgery in September and after seeing the results and being with her every step of the way, I knew it was something I had to do for myself as well. And there was no other option other than Dr. Barnett. He is an amazing surgeon and special person and we\'ve enjoyed knowing him not only as a professional but as a caring human being. I am so happy with the results that I am already planning my next surgery to help sculpt my body after major weight loss.Thank you a million times Dr. Barnett!'),(2855,264,5,'Dr. Barnett is an excellent Surgeon. I had a breast reduction and lift done. Believe me that couldn\'t have been an easy job but I now have the most beautiful breasts at the age of 60. He did an amazing job and I couldn\'t be any happier. He\'s a wonderful person who made the whole service before the surgery, surgery, and aftercare very easy on me. I couldn\'t recommend him any higher.'),(2856,264,5,'This was my first time working with Dr. Barnett and it was fantastic! I won\'t go into specifics, but will say that his attention to detail is spectacular. Amazing, yet subtle improvement ;I have a really crazy schedule, and they were very understanding and accommodating. There were no issues even when I had to cancel an appointment at the last minute.I\'ve given Dr. B many referrals and will be giving him more in the future!'),(2857,264,5,'So I got a BA done with Dr. Barnett a little over a month ago, but wanted to wait to leave the results until my postop was fully done. Well, now that\'s it over, all I can say is..........I LOVE IT!! I was terrified of the results looking fake or like some of those nightmare outcomes you see on TV, but they look so natural. All my friends love them and of course I\'ve already noticed I\'m getting more attention ;  Highly recommend Dr. B., he is not just a surgeon but an artist and art lover too!'),(2858,264,5,'Never before have I met a doctor who listened to me as well as Dr. Barnett. I booked a consult with him to discuss a very minor eyelid surgery operation and he gave me truly insightful advice. He showed me what the potential outcome could look like and explained all the postop and recovery so patiently. He really went above and beyond what I expected, which after a few bad consults was not much. This was the first plastic surgeon I met who made me feel like he actually cared about his patients and helping them achieve the best possible outcome. At this point I have no interest in finding a new surgeon, and highly recommend him and his staff is amazing as well! He could not have done a better job, and I could not be more happy with the outcome!'),(2859,264,1,'I saw dr. Barnett featured on the news buying fake yelp reviews. Bad ethics.'),(2860,264,5,'So a few years ago I was diagnosed as having a deviated septum as a result of a broken nose I had when I was younger. I had talked to both ear, nose and throat doctors and cosmetic surgeons about my options. I didn\'t really know which way to go as the ENT doctor was just going to fix the chipped bone and air blockage but a plastic surgeon could fix that and the slight indentationbump from the broken nose. In the end I chose Dr. Barnett as he understood both sides of the problem and had dealt with situations like this before. I couldn\'t be happier! Not only can I breathe out of my nose better now, but it looks like it used to before the break. Thanks Dr. Barnett'),(2861,264,5,'Without going into specifics, I had a noticeable asymmetry that needed correcting. I found Dr. Barnett after chance meetings with some of his fans aka patients, who highly recommended him to help me correct my problem. Dr. Barnett and I had several consultations before my procedure to ensure that everything would go as smoothly as possible. He is an artist as well see his website, so I knew my result would be stellar. I am very fussy and had a million questions for him, but he was very patient with me and had an excellent and warm bedside manner. He was very supportive in the postop period and made sure I was ok with phone calls for several days after my procedure. The healing process was as expected and not scary. I am very thankful to have met Dr. Barnett and I would recommend him to my friends and family.'),(2862,264,5,'Not only is Dr. Barnett a highly skilled, highly educated surgeon; simply put, he is a remarkable human being.For the past 34 years I had been researching procedures and surgeons. Doing my homework, meeting with them, visiting their offices to discuss a surgery that I knew I wanted but didn\'t have the clearest vision of. To be quiet honest, a lot of those surgeons didn\'t help me in finding the perfect procedure for my body. In fact, some left me more confused than ever. That all changed when I met Dr. Barnett.Immediately, he was able to listen to me not only as a surgeon but also as an artist and someone who genuinely cared... a man that sincerely wanted to give me the best result possible for my body, life, etc.In meeting with Dr. Barnett, I became very confident in moving forward and knew that I could not have any other surgeon sculpt my body.I truly cannot say enough wonderful things about Dr. Barnett and his staff Renee and Stephanie are two of the sweetest, most absolutely wonderful women.I had my surgery in September of 2014 and words cannot even begin to describe how elated I am every time I look down at the work that\'s been done. Not to mention, I FEEL so much better. Shortly after my surgery, my mother went to Dr. Barnett and had her surgery on Christmas Eve and has honestly experienced so much happiness from the results. In fact, she\'s already planning another visit for other areas of her body after a drastic weight loss and years of toning her physique as far as workouts could take her.If you are looking for a doctor that cares for his patients wellbeing, happiness and HEALTH with a keen eye for detail and a beautiful artist\'s touch Dr. Barnett is all that and more.'),(2863,264,5,'Being a plastic surgeon must be one of the hardest jobs in the world with respect to making all of your patients happy  all of the time. I bet too, most people who go to get work from a plastic surgeon are pretty particular and attentive in a way that if the slightest thing goes wrong  they notice fast. As a matter of fact, I bet some of us are real pieces of work.I had a lot of questions and did a lot of research before I did my BA a few years back; I had a 3 inch thick binder before my procedure even began. A good PS, in my mind, needs to be comfortable and attentive with a patient like this.I met Dr. Barnett after meeting with 3 or 4 other PS\'s in the Bay Area. He, by far, instilled the most confidence in me and I chose him to do my procedure. Unfortunately, I had CC after my BA and it drove me crazy having one breast that was stiff and oddly shaped compared to the other  even if it was only something I noticed. I went back to Dr. Barnett and he fixed it for me at a much reduced cost. It is now 3 years after my revision and everything is fine and my breasts are doing great. The results of plastic surgery do not always go the way you think they are going to go and when that happens you need to be in a relationship with a doctor who is willing to, most importantly, continue to instill confidence even more so than the original meet and greet and problem solve with you. I would go back to Dr. Barnett in a second. I just wish there was a 100% guarantee that nothing would go wrong with any & all procedures which won\'t happen in my life time & it was not such an expensive venture.'),(2864,264,5,'I saw Dr. Barnett for minor rhinoplasty surgery not too long ago. I did my research on all the top surgeons in the area, and Dr. Barnett\'s track record and comprehensive approach made me feel comfortable when I made a final decision. It\'s pretty cool that he loves art just as much as I do, so we bonded over that. Both pre and post op care were fine! His staff was informative and helpful. More important his focus on my needs helped me avoid a surgery a different surgeon had recommended that was obviously way overboard. And to top it all off I\'m much more satisfied with the outcome than the other 34 women I know who\'ve had the same procedure.'),(2865,264,5,'Decided to come here after one of my friends raved about her chemical peel that she got here. I was really hesitant as I\'ve never undergone any kind of elective beauty treatment before, but Dr. Barnett really put me at ease and made me feel comfortable by reassuring me that I wasn\'t going under the knife of anything. Anyways, his prices were inline with the other two plastic surgeons I researched, and the results were great. My skin looks so much more healthier now.'),(2866,264,5,'It\'s been almost 2 years since my neck and face lift with Dr. Barnett. It\'s interesting to look back at the past two years and reflect on how I feel now about how I look now. It turns out that as time has passed, I can see that the work Dr. Barnett did was much better than I may have originally been able to understand. The main thing is that because I never looked like I\'d had plastic surgery, I\'m now able to age looking better and looking natural. If I want to do Botox or some other procedure short of surgery, I can do so. If I want to just enjoy the boost I got two years ago and let age naturally show itself in my face I can do that. It\'s a subtle thing but because Dr Barnett avoided any attempt to make me look 20 or 30 years younger than I am...rather just make me look fresher, enhanced, I don\'t feel compelled to try to keep up a veneer that is unrealistic. I think I would go crazy trying to do so. So, it turns out that I\'m actually happier with how I look today than I was two years ago after the surgery. I see actresses and actors in movies and on television and many of them I feel sorry for. They had all the choices in the world to go to a good cosmetic surgeon to fight the obvious signs of aging for healthy reasons. What seems to me unhealthy and unfortunate is that many of them want too much...they want to completely deny the reality of time, turn back the clock and be 20 or 30 years younger than they are. I think it almost always backfires and they end up looking silly and sad. Anyway, that\'s my take...these folks must be very happy doing what they\'re doing....I hope they can keep it up! I\'m just happy I found the right surgeon for me.'),(2867,264,5,'My first thought when I think of Dr. Barnett: trust. I suffered a botched surgery with an incompetent surgeon over a decade ago and went to Dr. Barnett for help fixing it. He not only fixed it but the results came out as what I wanted the first time around. He was very forthcoming with me and encouraged me to explore all my options. He was not only sympathetic and compassionate regarding my needs, but I could tell he\'s committed to excellence. He is truly an artist of a surgeon. His front office was also very well trained in how to handle all the administrative issues that came up, in addition to putting me at ease about the whole thing. I was scared after my first nightmare experience but really happy with my results!'),(2868,264,5,'Dr. Barnett is magical! I had acne when I was younger and it really messed up my skin. Now that I\'ve grown up the acne\'s is gone but I still have some scarring. I talked to quite a lot of dermatologists and cosmetic surgeons about my options, and Dr. Barnett really impressed me with this understanding of how acne affects the skin and how the scarring works. We decided on a chemical peel and microdermabrasion on the sides of my neck and I could NOT be happier. Definitely recommended!'),(2869,264,5,'I had an amazing experience with Dr. Barnett. I was very nervous before the surgery and Dr. Barnett was there to answer all of my many questions and really put me at ease. I could not be happier with the result and will be recommending all of my friends. I feel so much better about my appearance. Dr. Barnett stayed in constant contact with me after my procedure so I understood what was going on. He is a fabulous doctor and will definitely be visiting him again for my next procedure.'),(2870,264,5,'I just finished a series of chemical peels and I\'m really happy with the result! I wasn\'t so much worried about wrinkles but I had rough skin and acne scars on the sides of my neck from when I was younger. I was always insecure about how it made me look older and not so attractive. After discussing my options they were really great about talking with me it became clear chemical peels were going to be a better fit for my budget and goals than microdermabrasion. I highly recommend Dr. Barnett!'),(2871,264,5,'This place is fantastic! My chemical peel was super easy and they were very informative re: the fact that weather can have an effect on your skin if you do it at the wrong time, and they educated me on all the ways to take care of my skin after the fact. I even bought the skin cream they were selling even tho I know it was probably the same thing you can get at the pharmacy for super cheap :p They really are that amazing. I can\'t speak on the actual plastic surgery operations, but I will be coming back here in the future!  Thoa'),(2872,264,5,'My experience with Dr. Barnett was absolutely wonderful. Not only am I ecstatic about my results but I was extremely pleased with how easy and painless my procedure was because of the care of Dr. Barnett and his staff. He takes pride in his work and truly spends the time to make sure you are comfortable and that the procedure is smooth and as easy as possible. Both the doctor and his assistant are wonderfully helpful and are always available to address any concerns pre and post operation. Hands down 5 stars. Thank you for your time and hard work, I couldn\'t be happier!'),(2873,264,1,'I had a complete face lift. Dr. Barnett promised to lower my upper left eyelid and added the charge I came out of surgery and it was not done. Dr. Barnett talked me into a chin implant and added the charge he gave me way too much chin. Dr. Barnett pulled my forehead skin so tight that my forehead height increased at least 38 inch between that and the chin, I had a much longer face. Dr. Barnett was suppose to fix my left ear the problem was only at the very top tip of the ear by the side of my face Dr. Barnett did not solve the problem and I had a scar in the back of the ear at least 114. He tried another surgery to correct the ear, still did not correct it and then almost severed a nerve in the back of the ear it is now uncomfortable to wear sunglasses. My eye shape upper lids looked great initially accept for puckers and creases in the inner cornersDr. Barnett said he could fix this and he proceeded to cut clear across the upper lid again and totally ruined the shape of my eyes. I also ended up with two lumps on each side of my neck just opposite the center of my neck someone told me I should have those lumps checked.I should add that my surgery I requested the first morning surgery was scheduled for 11 am and I was not taken into surgery until 1:15 pm. If the previous patient asked for additional surgery at the last minute, as Dr. Barnett said. then they should have had to reschedule rather than making my surgery 214 hours late I almost walked out because I had a headache so bad and wished I had.He is very suave and makes you feel very confident. Beware!!! I wish I had never gone to him as I do not look like myself anymore and the before was better.I believe Dr. Barnett is currently riding on some of his past successes, raking in the money, and he truly does not really care how you look.'),(2874,264,5,'Writing this review for Dr. Andrew Barnett is an absolute pleasure!!!Dr. B performed my cosmetic surgery in June of 2013. What I know firsthand is that his skills are just as impeccable as his credentials. After months of researching cosmetic surgeons, reading tons of online reviews, meeting and interviewing other doctors, I met Dr. Barnett. His confidence, his passion, and his absolute love for what he does was immediately apparent.I had several meetings with Dr. B, in which he took the time to listen to all of my concerns. He was extremely informative, upfront about expectations, and very focused on giving me the results I was looking for. He is also a very kind person. I scheduled my surgery, and Dr. Barnett performed a facelift, forehead lift, neck lift, and also did my upper and lower eyelids.My request of Dr. Barnett was that I still look like me, just an improved, less tired looking version of myself, without looking like I had a facelift. I wanted to keep my eye shape, didn\'t want an expressionless wide eyed, tight skin facelift like some women I\'ve seen in the Bay Area. My natural looking results exceeded anything that I could have imagined. My husband swears I look 15 years younger. Most people simply say Wow! You look so good, what have you been doing? You look amazing!I simply could not be happier with the results. Dr. B also performed a breast lift and augmentation for me a couple of months ago. I am so glad that I listened to his recommendation on the size that he thought would be best for my frame, because they are PERFECT. I cannot believe how quickly the scars have faded, and I am beyond happy with the natural look and feel of my breasts....not to mention how THRILLED my husband is. The TLC I experienced at St. Francis Hospital where my procedures were performed, and the friendly and caring nature of Stephanie, at Dr. Barnett\'s office, also made a lasting impression.For me, the best part of my experience with Dr. Barnett is waking up in the morning and being happy with what I see in the mirror, AND I still look like me.  Now, I look like I feel, and what that has done for my outlook on life cannot be put into words. Dr. B, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Stephanie, you are an angel. Please take the time to check out Dr. Barnett\'s artistic endeavors on his website. He really is a true artist, LOVES his work, and is the absolute best in his field. Do something lifechanging for yourself. Go see Dr. B, you will thank him.'),(2875,264,5,'A few years ago I went in search of a Dr. who could make me look a little younger than I actually am, who could help me to look refreshed, but not in a obvious way. I kept hearing Dr. Barnett\'s name from several different sources. He is the one who will under do it. They say the only surgery you notice is bad surgery. I can truly say without a doubt I don\'t look like I\'ve had anything done. I just look like maybe 1015 years have been shaved off.  I really trust Dr. Barnett, he is an artist and a great surgeon. He is very skilled and confident. He is extremely talented at what he does. I highly recommend him. In the years to come I will return to him for anything else I may need.'),(2876,264,5,'A few months ago I had a biking accident while out with some friends. The injury was right above my left eye and required stitches. Luckily I was with Dr. Barnett and some other people when it happened or I\'m not sure what I would\'ve done. I was pretty scared with blood running down my face but he really put me at ease. The actual process took just a few minutes and was totally painless. And unless you look up close in one of those enhancing mirrors you can\'t even see the scars! I know it\'s not quite plastic surgery but he was so compassionate and obviously skilled with his hands. I don\'t know about these negative reviews below, but I highly recommend him!'),(2877,264,5,'I had a minor accident a few months ago, which resulted in my requiring stitches above my eye.

She is very professional and kind!! Love her! I give her a 5 Star!!'),(2879,264,5,'Dr Barnett exceeded all my expectations. He is a caring, gentle, and highly skilled surgeon. At our first meeting he showed me with a very simple computer program exactly what my options were and what his surgical plan was. No Glitzy, algorithm driven program. He performed a face lift, neck lift, eyelid lift and earlobe reduction.I experienced no significant post operative pain. There was the anticipated inconvenience of the surgical dressings and need to stay flat on your back for for 24 hours, but there was no significant pain, swelling, or bruising. I am more than pleased with the results. I looked and felt rejuvenated and still do. I originally selected Dr Barnett because a very close acquaintance of mine had the same experience with him; that is to say an excellent result with very little post operative discomfort, swelling or bruising. The selection of a plastic surgeon is a decision you can\'t really afford to be wrong on. I am most pleased I had the fortune to be cared for by Dr Andrew Barnett.'),(2880,264,5,'I just had a Breast Augmentation & Liposuction of upperlower abs, innerouter thighs & flanks. I\'m very happy! I LOVE the way my body looks. Boobs  I went for a slight increase, and think that is the best choice ever for the boobs :  I didn\'t want to go back to work and have it be glaringly obvious that I had been enhanced. Mission accomplished. Dr. Barnett is quite the master of breast augmentation. I went for the underarm entry, scars healing fine.Lipo  WooHoo! I love my results! My profile looks so much better. No more spare tire. Dr. Barnett kept it real before the surgery and told me I had a little too much fat around my mid section & he wasn\'t going to take all of it out  so that my skin will still look tight afterward. My biggest fear going into this was sagging skin and there\'s none of that. I can bend over and not have a big hanging pouch anymore. Dr. Barnett took out just the right amount of fat. Dr. Barnett is a really nice doctor & intelligent professional. He has amazing credentials & experience which is a major reason why I chose him. I felt comfortable with him as my doctor from the start. I had 3 consultations before finally going back to my first choice which was Dr. Barnett. He & his office staff are super cool and amazing. Aftercare is just as important as having a successful surgery and his office is always there to answer questions. For me, this a was positive experience all around.I just have to comment on some of his other reviews  I read them all before choosing a doctor  as most people do. This did not deter me from choosing him to do my surgery. I went for a few consultations as everyone should before making this type of decision.  I made my choice based on not really liking the other doctors as much and my intuition that Dr. Barnett was going to do a good job. So, I say Dr. Barnett is a perfect gentleman of a doctor and people who haven\'t actually had work done by him shouldn\'t leave such negative reviews just bc their feelings got hurt or they had a bad commute to his office. I mean c\'mon, everyone knows SF parking sucks and you need to give yourself more time if you have to do parking etc.... I think Dr. B is lucky he never had to do any work on those people because they clearly have issues. He really doesn\'t deserve some of the comments he gets. He gave me the body I always wanted.'),(2881,264,5,'I just want to say to the people who\'ve written bad reviews of Dr. Barnett: A plastic surgeon is not a miracle worker especially when it comes to Liposuction. There is only so much fat that can be safely removed by Lipo, and I\'m sure that Dr. Barnett\'s primary concern wasis always the safety of his patients. To say that he disfigured you or to suggest that he would willfully disfigure any patient of his is an inflammatory accusation and , I\'m certain, a complete exaggeration of your postoperative results. You may be unhappy with the results and that may have caused you to exaggerate profusely, but that\'s no excuse for making a claim of disfigurement. It\'s a testament to the kind of man Andrew Barnett is that he hasn\'t made a libel or slander claim against you!Dr. Barnett has been a friend of my parents for 25 years. He has been my plastic surgeon since 2003 when I elected to have him perform breast augmentation surgery for me. I absolutely love the results, which have remained my perfect, CD cup breasts for the past ten years. I have referred many friends to Dr. Barnett for Breast augmentation and every one of them have had spectacular results, even those who had very saggy, unattractive breasts to begin with.  Dr. Barnett put my implants in through a 34 inch cut he made in my armpits the mark left by this incision lasted less than a year and there is currently no evidence of any incision on my body. The implants are under the muscle, and every man who has ever seen or felt them has told me that they are indistinguishable from naturally large breasts, except for the fact that they are still perky and gorgeous and I am now three months shy of forty years old. I am in excellent shape otherwise, so my boyfriend originally attributed my perky, sagfree breasts to my exercise regimen. Ha! As if there is any way to work out a mass of glands, skin and fat! Anyway, I think Dr. Barnett is an excellent, caring surgeon, a true artist at heart and an elegant gentleman. Which brings me to the final thing I wanted to address. I have never, in the 20 years I have known Dr. Barnett, I have never witnessed him being arrogant toward ANYONE. I think these people may have mistaken Dr. Barnett\'s honesty as to the results these people could expect as arrogance. The fact is, honesty is often hard to hear, especially when it comes to a very sensitive subject like our physical appearance. But isn\'t it better to have a doctor tell you the truth?'),(2882,264,5,'Dr. Andrew Barnett is an excellent surgeon. In 2011, Dr. Barnett performed a long overdue tummy tuck and repaired an abdominal hernia that had not been noticed or diagnosed by my regular doctor.

I healed quickly and my body continues to look awesome.'),(2883,264,5,'Dr. Andrew Barnett is as close to perfection as one can get in seeking out a plastic surgeon!

I posted pictures but they\'ve been removednot by me. The results have left me scared for life. He agreed to fix the problem at no cost but then said I would need to have a tummy tuck for $20 thousand to fix the results of that fix? Not much of an offer to fix a problem. He prefaced his offer by saying it can take up to a year for the body to total recover from surgery or is that when the threat of a lawsuit subsides for a physician? What happened to agreeing to fix the problem in a way that would be comfortable for the patient up to and including paying for them to have the damage fixed by another physician or a less invasive procedure? Poor pre surgical prep: I was completely unprepared for just how invasive lipo was going to be the blood and downtime! I would never willingly undergo that process if the after effects and recovery had been explained realistically.Best interest for the patient not regarded: Dr. Barnett never asked if I was allergic to latex prior to surgery. Who doesn\'t ask that these days? What medical facility  Doctor does not have options for people who are? Dr. Barnett is. Like many patients I was given the typical surgery forms to complete on the day of the surgery. One form asked me to list anything I am allergic to and I wrote down latex. He panicked! Saying he did not have anything that was nonlatex! He was obviously not prepared. He did not think that this lack of preparation and threat of potential harm for me was enough to reschedule the surgery. Instead he turns the tables on me and he told me never to tell a Doctor that I am allergic to latex??? So my regular doctors ,who all agree I have a latex allergy by the swelling and bumps I get all over my skin when I touch latex, are wrong?Pricing: He gave me one price then 8 months later he contacts me and asks for another $1000. He said he took longer in the operating room and that I owed him and hospital more money?? Eight months later? Really?My experience is this is NOT a Competent Physician for Lipo!

He\'s an amazing cosmetic surgeon who actually doesn\'t do any outside marketing it\'s all word of mouth. Highly intelligent, warm bedside manner, informative, artistic these are all adjectives I\'d use to describe Dr. Barnett. During my consultation, he actually answered all the questions I had on my list to ask him. He definitely took his time with me, I didn\'t feel rushed or pressured. His work is amazing. My surgery went brilliantly. Dr. Barnett held my hand as I drifted off to dream land. When I woke up, I was actually not in any pain. He called me over the weekend some days twice just to check on me and see how I was doing. I\'ve never had a doctor do that before. Now, I don\'t want to brag, but my result is nothing short of fabulous. Unbelievable! My breasts are slightly smaller, as I wanted... and I swear they look completely natural and real. They are softer than before, and the shape is so real. I recommend Dr. Barnett very, very highly. I\'m so excited for swimsuit and sundress season to get here!'),(2890,264,5,'I saw Dr Barnett a few years ago and if I ever start to show age, I may see him againI have recommended him to friends and I they have been pleased with their results and his professionalism.I am not an easy patient. I was a pain in the arse and called his office every other day with questions. He always called me back quickly and reassured me or had me scheduled to see him in his office that day. What else could you want?I cannot say anything negative about the experience.  He is a wonderful Doctor'),(2891,264,5,'.After years of being unsatisfied with what age and breast feeding had done to my breasts, I finally got the courage to do something about it. I am a 43 year old mother of two.    I was determined that I did not want to have a lift.even though I knew I needed it I was very concerned about scars. The first doctor I interviewed confirmed that I did need a lift and when I expressed to her that I was so bothered by that, she became willing to compromise her beliefs and insert implants over the muscle. Later I learned this would have resulted in heavy drooping breast that I most likely would have been unsatisfied with.     My first visit with Dr. Barnett started with the office having a scheduling conflict. Most of my experience in doctors offices are we\'ll get to you when we can but Dr. Barnett personally came out and introduced himself and explained about the conflict. He assured me he would accommodate me shortly. I had never experienced the DR. himself explaining the scheduled timing conflict and I knew right away I was going to like him.   Our visit was wonderful, he was very informative and patient with all my questions and it was quite enjoyable, .   He of course told me I needed a lift, implants alone would not give me the results I desire. My husband and I both felt very at ease with him, there was no doubt in my mind that he would be my surgeon.  I now am 6 12 weeks post op. I had a lollipop lift and 220cc\'s textured silicone implants .My entire experience has been absolutely positive and amazing. The surgery center was fantastic and staffed with wonderful caring people. They all spoke very highly of Dr. Barnett.   The surgery itself was easy and I was off pain meds in a day and a half. Yes it is a big surgery but it was totally tolerable.     The recovery time is the hard part. I had a couple little issues and had to call with questions. Everytime I called I spoke with Tracy my patient consultant. She assured me of what to do and what was normal and as soon as Dr. Barnett was out of surgery he called and discussed the issue. He was always very comforting and reassuring. He even called back on a Saturday when I had spoken to him friday and told him that things seemed fine.    My results are incredible! What was I waiting for? The size is perfect  exactly what I was hoping for a Full C. The best part is people who know me can\'t tell. They are feeling very natural and soft and the scars I was so worried about are healing wonderfully and I have to say are so worth the great breasts I now have.  Dr. Barnett is truly an artist and he is amazing! I am so ecstatic about my new Breasts, my only regret is that I waited so long being un happy with my body.  I reccomend him so highly I would insist any of my family members considering plastic surgery only go to Dr. Barnett.'),(2892,264,1,'Dr. Barnett is friendly in a fake sort of way, a little arrogant, and I\'d say a pretty careless plastic surgeon. I chose him to perform a breast augmentation for me back in 2002 and the results were disastrous. First off, let me tell you that he came highly recommended and wasn\'t exactly cheap. The surgery cost nearly $7000. My goal was to go from notevenanAcup to a full Bcup...nothing crazy and overinflated, I just wanted normal breasts. Well, after Dr. B. was done with me, I was pretty close to a Dcup. Not only that, I ended up getting capsular contracture in one breast and symmastia. When I went to see Dr. B for my postop checkups, he never told me I had these complications. It was only after I visited another cosmetic surgeon for a second opinion that I learned of this.Capsular contracture is a complication that occurs when the scar tissue around the implants hardens to an unnatural degree. Symmastia is a pretty nasty complication that results from forcing too large an implant into too small a frame. Your skin is basically being lifted off the sternum, eradicating the space between your breasts and causing them to come together, forming a uniboob. That\'s right, one big boob in the middle of your chest. Completely avoidable had he chosen the rightsized implant to begin with.I picked Dr. Barnett to do my surgery to begin with because he places breasts implants through the underarm in order to eliminate scarring on the breast. Well, when he had to perform a second surgery on me to fix the problems that he had created and didn\'t even tell me about btw he had to cut up my breasts, leaving scars on both of them, which is what I paid big bucks to avoid in the first place. And just for the record, the revision surgery didn\'t do squat, I now had capsular contracture, symmastia, AND scars. He offered to perform another surgery to fix THOSE problems, but I basically wasn\'t going to let this quack touch me again, so that was that.2 other acquaintances of mine from the bay area also chose Dr. B to do their breast augmentations, both did not like their results. One was really disappointed at how her breasts turned out. She said that they felt funny and were much bigger than she\'d originally wanted them to be. She also said that she felt really pressured by Dr. B to go up a size larger than she\'d wanted and regretted that decision. The second girl who had her breasts done by Dr. B found that 2 years later, one of her implants had fallen out of its pocket. Yikes! She ended up having that problem fixed by Dr. Loren Eskenazi.I ended up switching to Dr. Loren Eskenazi who was recommended by that acquaintance to fix me up. After a couple of tries, she was eventually able to solve my boob issues. Yay!'),(2893,265,5,'I just have to say that I love Dr Ulrich! I told my partner that I was semi serious about trying to befriend her outside of my appointments. She led me all the way through some challenging stuff and more recently through my pregnancy.

Can\'t recommend her enough!'),(2894,265,5,'Dr Ulrich is an amazing doctor. Having to see a gynecologist for the first time in my late teens and early 20\'s was a really scary experience and I\'m really grateful to have found a doctor like her.

Mary is awesome!!! She takes the time to listen, she remembers stuff you talked about on the last visit, she\'s up to date with your chart info some doctors read in when they come in or look like they\'re in a rush to leave as soon as they enter the room. She\'s like a good friend or a big sister  more than a doctor. When you\'re having a baby, its a big deal and to have a doctor who is there for you to listen and to reassure you and offer personal advice about her own experience in having a baby is great!After our third child we bought a house outside the city and we changed our insurance to Kaiser which really bummed me: It was tough on me knowing that Mary wouldn\'t be my obgyn anymore: What I do know is that if I have another child, I\'m switching my insurance back!New Entry : 21012Turns out we had one more baby! As true to promise, I switched insurance and seeing Dr.ULrich after 1 12 yrs was like greeting an old friend again. While I had switched she had another child too so with more medals under her belt she seemed even more well versed with the reality of birth and motherhood.She was there for the delivery of my fourth baby right through which was great. Everything went smooth from start to finish. It pays to have a OBGYN that you can feel 100% comfortable with!'),(2896,265,5,'I was devastated when Dr. Hagbom retired. Happy for him  he deserves some time to relax without a busy practice to consider  but sad because he\'d been my doctor for so long. Knowing that all the physicians in the practice are pretty good, I asked the front desk to give me the first available appointment since I was nearly a year overdue for my annual check under the hood.  Luck of the draw brought me to Dr. Ulrich. Turns out she is funny, smart, knowledgeable, personable, unflappable  everything a good ladyparts doc should be. Too young to retire anytime soon, too, hehe.'),(2897,265,5,'When my wife told her gyn that she was thinking of getting pregnant, she told her that there was a new OB doc in the practice who would be perfect for us. She was so right. I\'ve had the pleasure of accompanying my wife to many of her OB visits during her pregnancy and she absolutely ADORES Dr. U. Her personality is terrific: friendly, open, kind and enthusiastic. You get the feeling that she is truly excited about the pregnancy. From a technical perspective, she is topnotch too: she\'s clearly familiar with all the current trends, thinking and best practices in obstetrics whilst being open to our own preferences. When we told her we wanted to try for as few medical interventions as possible she embraced that goal and guided us through our decisions by providing sound medical opinion without forcing anything on us that wasn\'t medically necessary.When the time came for the delivery, we were super lucky that she was on call on our due date no less! and that she was actually at the hospital lucky, since my wife ended up delivering about 30 minutes after we arrived! We couldn\'t have asked for a better person to guide our little girl safely into the world.'),(2898,265,5,'When my old obgyn Dr. Hagbom retired, I was at a loss. I had seen him for years. I decided to take the automatic referral to Dr. Ulrich, and I\'m so glad I did. First, it\'s nice having a woman doctor when you\'re a woman. But even better, Dr. Ulrich is someone you can really talk to in plain language and she will listen and give you plain talk back. Also, she encourages patients to call with questions, so you don\'t always have to make an appointment just to get a simple question answered. I like that she\'s younger than I am so that I don\'t have to deal with a retiring doctor again! ;'),(2899,265,5,'Dear Dr. Ulrich,Thank you for helping us bring Arhya into this world healthy and well.We were a little scared initially when Arhya decided to come on the very week Dr. Cabrera was out of town.

She is very sweet and very knowledgeable. Another thing I like is that she has a little one at home, so I think the experience is fresh for her so it\'s sort of like talking with a friend. I also like that even though she has a ton of patients to see, she doesn\'t seem rushed and seems like she genuinely wants to know if I have any questions or concerns. I try to go in there with my questions laid out before hand so I don\'t waste time, but I don\'t feel like I HAVE to do that.

After being made to wait 45 minutes we asked whether it would be much longer. We were told it would be another ten minutes. After fifteen minutes, we asked again how much longer and were told that a patient with a 10:45 appointment was just now being seen. We left.

She is supportive, energetic, technically excellent, and listens carefully to everything you say and, I got a sense, also to what you don\'t say. Our first appointment lasted for 1.5 hour, where she had me recount my personal medical story and we discussed our philosophies about pregnancy and childbirth. I found her openminded, honest, and respectful of what your particular choices might be. If those choices happen to collide with her own belief of what constitutes appropriate care, she will discuss them with you, but always in a non judgmental way.

Throughout my pregnancy, she always made me feel very comfortable, was very knowledgeable and patient with questions, and always had a cheerful and happy attitude. She always explained what she was doing during exams and made sure I was comfortable. Her bedside manner is incredible  she\'s extremely caring and nurturing.

Knowing this can\'t be normal, I used the Zoc Doc app to find a doctor in my network that could see me that same day.

After kindly asking my medical history, and symptoms he took a look in my ear There was no cotton. What the other doctor saw was scar tissue from earlier procedures. Weird all that work for nothing! The real cause of my problem was that I had an ear infection that ruptured from my flight. I explained that I was not local, and that I had to return home on a flight tomorrow. Doctor Rastani explained that because of this I am a good candidate for the Myringotomy. This would essentially put a small hole in my ear drum that will help to drain it. Being that I had to fly right away, this would be a contained cut that would allow for less pressure on my ears for take off and landing.I was extremely nervous I asked a zillion questions and Doctor Rastani was so patient with me. Afterwards he walked me through the entire procedure, let me know what was happening, and a minute later I was done!

Turns out I had fluid and an infection in both of my ears. Dr. Rastani prescribed a course of antibiotics, but also explained had I could have a procedure done to relieve the pressure immediately.

I may not be the best person to judge on the technology they use to clean ears these days since it had been awhile since the last time I got them cleaned by a doctor, but I remember back in the day they just used to shoot water pressure into your ear and watch all your nasty ear junk fall out into this little bowl you had to hold next to your ear.

I realize I\'m not a rich lady paying for Botox or whatever I was there for persistent adult acne and other issues, which he never gave me a chance to mention, but I\'m still a patient in the office requiring care and attention to my concerns. In the 5 minutes or less than? that he was in the appointment, he got very defensive when I mentioned that a therapy he suggested has never worked for me in the past, asking me what do you want to do, then? in an aggressive way. Frankly, I was shocked and disappointed, because I\'ve been a patient of his for EIGHT years, on and off while I\'ve lived in the area, and never experienced such rudeness from him, or any doctor, ever and I\'ve seen many. Whenever I tried to ask a question or even describe the recent trajectory of my symptoms, he cut me off by saying I know you\'re frustrated, without any indication that he actually registered what I was saying or letting me finish speaking. I came to see him again because I appreciated his confidence and straightforward manner in past visits, but the last time I saw him was a few years ago. Since then it seems that he\'s become impatient and rude, while the office has gotten fancier, indicating at least to me a shift in the tone of his practice and desired patients or clientele, rather. Also, I had some cortisone injections done to reduce inflammation in some lesions, but his nurse did them, not him, which I\'ve never experienced before in any dermatologic visits, with him or anyone else this didn\'t influence my rating, but I thought I\'d mention it.I\'ve never written a review on Yelp before, but this was a really unpleasant experience and there are probably many other dermatologists worth checking out, especially if you\'re dealing with noncosmetic dermatologic issues. I\'m disappointed to write it, too, because I\'ve been a loyal patient over the years.

I would say I had pretty good skin.Last year back in MarchApril, I stated to break out like crazy! Even at areas I never had acne. I started going to expensive facial every 10 days to clean out my pores, however, it did not work and made my skin super sensitivered. It was in July, I finally decided to visit a dermatologist since nothing worked from expensive facials to skincare. During that period of time, I was afraid to go out because my skin was so bad. If you had serious acne, you will know foundationmakeup can cover up redness, but not the texture of the skin. On my first visit, Dr Kwan assured me that he understands how frustrated it is to have acne and my skin can be improved by 50% within one month under tropical cream. He gave me some free samples that will last me until my next visit. Fast forward, I will say my skin did not improve until the fourth visit which is 4 months after my first visit where he changed up my tropical cream and I started taking antibiotics. When it is the right regime, your skin will clear up in one month. You will not experience any new breakouts aside from hormonal pimples and your old ones will start to clear up. I took antibiotics for three month and have been off the pill for 2 months now. So far, I am very happy with the result. My skin is smooth. The only problem I have now is with discoloration.

Well, here we are, one year since my last visit, when Kwan and I discussed the scars on the back of my neck  from hives or cysts or something I keep getting from time to time. The point is no doctor has been able to figure out what it is. He said come in when they are forming next time. I figured that was a good sign. He would take time to look at the issue when it counts. After all, if I had to wait for an appointment, it would be too late. So, I went in to the office as instructed today and I was treated like a peasant. Gibran, the Office Manager, was a shady, gatekeeping, condescending pric& who had the nerve to tell me well we haven\'t seen you in a year and Dr Kwan said he never talked to you about cysts and Dr Kwan won\'t be able to see you today but I could schedule an appointment for you. He wouldn\'t even give up the wifi password so I could check my email while I waited for this ingenious insult. How many of us can guess that it makes more sense for them to allow me to continue to scar so they can make more money off of me for laser treatments, instead of trying to help me identify an actual skin condition? Prioritizing profit and cosmetic procedures INDEED. The man is my DERMOTOLOGIST and THE NAPE OF MY NECK HAS A RISING BOIL ON IT but Dr Kwan and his staff couldn\'t be bothered today.

I was blown away by the service of the receptionist and nurses who all seemed incredibly attentive.

It is nice to finally find a dr. who sees you as a person and wants to help, instead of just dollar signs to bill the insurance companies.'),(2968,267,5,'Dr. Kwan and everyone on his staff is knowledgeable, caring, and patient. I have seen Dr. Kwan for both cosmetic issues and medical issues. I have found him to be at the highest level of professionalism.

I have also worked with Janine the in house esthetician and I ADORE her. I have gone to many medspas and never have I encountered an esthetician with her level of service and caring. She explained every step of my procedure and made sure I was comfortable at every stage.

Called this office 6 weeks ago for a general check up, no skin problems to report , just being proactive as I recently turned fifty. When I made the appointment, I provided my insurance information at which time I was informed they accepted Anthem Blue Cross. I have an EPO which allows me to move through the process of selecting my doctors with no referral from a Primary Care MD. Consumers pay a substantial premium for this insurance freedom. However, just to be safe I requested they contact my insurance company before I committed to an appointment just to be uber safe. The office informed me my plan was covered in their office. Upon arrival for my appointment I was informed I needed to pay a self pay of $175.00 before seeing the doctor because my insurance was part of Covered CA. Clearly this office seems to think they can discriminate against consumers based on where they purchased their insurance. Lets be clear , I am not covered my Covered CA, I am covered by Anthem Blue Cross  their Platinum Plan  the most expensive plan they offer with all the bells and whistles. After to being asked to pay $175.00 up front to see the dr. I asked for my insurance card and DL and left the office. Ten minutes later the money hungry office called me and informed me they would accept my insurance. I informed them I was not interested, and in fact they would be reported to the insurance commissioner of CA for discrimination. I then received another harassing call by someone saying I understand you have a problem with your insurance.....blah blah blah. I don\'t have a problem with my insurance. I have a problem with your office , your practices your inability to understand the difference between Covered CA and a contract with Anthem Blue Cross as a carrier. The worst service, clearly money hungry, and extremely short sighted. As it turns out, I am a avid users of Botox, gels and other cosmetic skin care products paid at a premium , full price and out of pocket.

She cleared my skin up as much as possible then recommended I see the office esthetician Janine for maintenance.Janine is great. I\'d never seen an esthetician before but I\'ve been battling my skin for 10+ years so I was willing to try anything. I did Accutane a year ago and expected perfection when I was finished but it stayed clear for a few months then reverted back. Janine has done Accutane twice and totally gets how you feel and what you\'re looking for. I see her once a month for medical facials and my skin is now spotless without taking any pills. She has cleared it up, gotten rid of all spotty redness, and gotten rid of the oiliness which is amazing.

He listens and responds and takes a conservative approach to maintain a natural appearance which is exactly what I want. Since I started seeing Dr. Kwan I receive frequent compliments on my skin. He practices with integrity and genuinely wants his patients to be happy with the results. I\'ve requested a couple of expensive procedures and he\'s taken time to discuss the anticipated results and been honest when the results of the procedure most likely wouldn\'t meet my expectations.

Dr. Kwan\'s diagnosis was much more thorough, talked about the options and expectations. He did a deeper treatment than my previous doctor and while he did not guarantee perfect results due to various reasons, the outcome was almost exactly what I had hoped for. The cost for his services were on par actually cheaper than my previous doctor.

He looked my skin over and set up a regimen to clear the problem up. His staff is as patient and kind as he is. Being a prior sun worshipper, I have been going to dermatologists most of my life at the request of my mom for mole checks, and various other types of skin care. He is truly one of the best I have seen.Update: I needed to add to this review. This is a testament to how good Dr. Kwan and his staff are. I was in Santa Barbara after my father in law passed away. I had an allergic reaction and needed a prescription from Dr. Kwan to take care of it. He had treated it years before and it had worked.

Dr. Kwan made me feel like my time is respected, which is usually not what you get when going to a doctor\'s appointment. I was seen exactly at my scheduled appointment time for both of my visits. What?!? Seeing a doctor at your scheduled time?!? Is that even possible? Yes, it is, so don\'t be late. I also love that everything is electronic at the office. During my minor surgery, the Dr and I chatted about movies and social media. He was very kind and did a great job distracting me from the fact that he was cutting my head open.

He didn\'t look at my feet that had eczema on it, just glanced and said ya you probably have it and never looked at my hands which I should say at the time the eczema on one of my fingers was sooo bad a nail was clinging on for dear life and I told him the symptoms I had and he went on this computer and printed out some prescriptions for me. I had questions about how to deal with eczema, he just brushed them off and conveniently said to come back in two weeks if its the same.

Cool office, it\'s very modern. My boyfriend has been going to him for the past year. I went because I\'d been having very dry skin that would sometimes ooze if it got too dry, what I thought was some form of eczema, but had other things I wanted to run by him.I went in and was seen pretty quickly. And I mean very quickly. He probably spent no more than 15 minutes with me. We reviewed my skin habitshistory, which he typed out onto a computer. I was also quite concerned about the constantly flushed, bumpy texture of my skin on my lower cheek and jaw bone and arms. I often get those firm white bumps on my arm also that acts almost like a zit but isn\'t. I had been using AmLactin for it per a docter\'s recommendation, so I was hoping to get some answers on what else to do. I also had two moles on my back I wanted to get checked.Short story short, he prescribed me a topical liquid to help get rid of the painful flare up it worked and then told me that the flushed, bumpy skin is a genetically passed on condition that is a dominant genie  there\'s no fixing it and my kids will have it. I can keep my skin moist, drink water and it will appear less red, but there is no getting rid of it. He did suggest that I abandon AmLactin, since it was much heavier in alpha hydroxy than he\'d like and switch to Cetaphil\'s derma line. My moles were perfectly healthy, I could have them removed but he warned against it for scarring. The receptionist wasn\'t very warm and friendly, but then again I\'m not there to chit chat. Also got tons of free samples. I think what really killed me is that I paid a $35 copay plus the prescription costed about another $40. Not his fault, it\'s my insurance, but wasn\'t prepared for it. He did a thorough job and I will go back if I ever have a skin flare up of some sort. Guess I should be glad nothing more serious!

I wrote this with my own will. Please ensure this gets posted according to your proper rating standards.***Fellow Yelpers,I have been going to Dr. Bell since March 2011. I was transferred from pathetic Concentra by the nurse my employer hired due to Workers Comp concerns to her care.That said, you can conclude that I injured myself at work. L4S1 disc slip that continually worsened while in Concentra\'s care or lack of. So when I was transferred to her, I was relieved. Especially since my nurse who was independently contracted did extensive research on her resume.Turns out she was truly fantastic and has been ever since. I had a very difficult time managing my pain and my posture as well. I couldn\'t walk or even lie down without major discomfort. I honestly felt depressed and extremely hopeless; even worse since I was a very active individual and athlete. Especially since I lost my pending promotion at work due to this injury.As soon as my first appointment with Dr. Bell, she gave me a more precise diagnosis and was able to develop a plan for Maximum Improvement within the month. I went along with her recovery plan. Besides just putting me on medications like Concentra did and their idea of therapy, she was able to refer me to a magnificent chiropractor Dr. Grimes, a useful stretchingexercise systemregimen, as well as epidural injections with the cooperation of other doctors she works with, I was able to not only walk upright again without the use of a cane, but to have faith in my body again and confident enough to find a new job that would be able to accomodate me and my current limitations. While there are limitations I must still live with, they are reasonable and have been kept to a minimum. Whereas before I couldn\'t even lift 10 lbs without extreme pain, I am able to lift up to 40 lbs. with a lot less pain and possibly more.. She never pushed me beyond my limits, but inspired and had enough faith in me and my recovery to push where needed.Besides all the help she has provided me with in my recovery, she is ALSO a very cool, laidback, and funny person. My comfort level is to the point where I wouldn\'t mind hanging out with her. We pretty much know what\'s going on in each other\'s lives, and considering how many patients she sees, that\'s a very impressive trait to have for ANY individual.Therefore, I am still her patient and plan on being in the longterm until I move out of the Bay Area. And when I do, I am planning on bringing her along with me!!!! LOLjkHope this review is helpful enough to inspire you to give her a shot; especially if you are dealing with impossible doctors.

The quality of care that I get from Dan and One Medical is fantastic. Everyone should have access to such great care. I have so many good things to say...this is going to be a long review.First off, upon joining up and my initial evaluation Dan and his team identified an underlying medical issue that had been the source of other issues that had gone undiagnosed for MANY MANY years. The level of attention, listening, dot connecting and then coordination across Dan\'s team that went on in the matter of a short time was amazing.

He doesn\'t pretend to know more than he does, he leverages the expertise of other MDs in the practice when needed. This means I get the benefit of lots of care, experience and perspective for the best outcome possible.Though I don\'t expect him to remember details about me amidst all of his patients, he remembers little things that make the interactions feel personal.Not only can I make same day appointments though he might not be the MD that I see but when I had an urgent need afterhours I had the option to leave him a message on his cell phone versus the oncall. He called me back at 11pm and did realtime scheduling with me for a followup appointment.He\'s very considerate of cost implications and whether or not you have insurance when advising you on approaches though he always makes the medical necessitybottom line clear. If I\'ve ever walked away and thought of another quick question, I\'ve always been able to email him to clarify which is super helpful.Lastly, I love that I can do lab work form their offices versus going elsewhere.Couldn\'t be happier with Dan Dinenberg and One Medical.'),(3004,269,4,'I had originally given this review a twostar rating.

On a last minute appointment with the Metropolitan Medical Group, I decided to see Dr. Dinenberg because he was the first available that day. He was friendly and overall, a nice guy. As a doctor, he had good bedside manner and was patient. He listened to my problem, checked it up, and then explained to me what the problem could be and referred me to a specialist at California Pacific Medical Center. He lent me crutches, which he also spent several minutes explaining how to use, only allowing me to leave with them after I could do several laps in the hallway first.I would recommend the Metropolitan Medical Group to those seeking a medical professional.

For about a week now I\'ve had this horrific pain in my throat that doesn\'t really have any other associated symptoms.After a disappointing experience with yet another inadequate doctor, the environment at One Medical and Dinenberg\'s approach was incredibly refreshing. Dinenberg spoke with me for a while about my symptoms and then began a thorough examination and performed a quick strep test that turned out to be inconclusive.In addition to prescribing me antibiotics, Dinenberg pulled out his prescription pad to recommend to additional homeremedies to treat my ailment: gargling with a tumericsalt solution and drinking gingerlemon honey tea.But that\'s not all. He also shot out a handful of other crosscultural remedies that he suggested I may want to consider including chicken soup and pho.If you feel like going to a doctor ought to be more like hiring a consultant and less like sending yourself to prison, I highly recommend both Dan Dinenberg and One Medical Group.

I have been seeing Dr. Robert Minkowsky for over two years now. I have scoliosis in my thoracic spine that has been the source of ongoing difficulty for years. I saw chiropractors and did yoga and nothing helped in the long run  I would hit a plateau and not move beyond it. I have been amazed at how Dr. Minkowsky has helped improve function. I was able to start running again after three year within a few months of starting treatment. The skin rolling while not pleasant has broken up the adhesions that were the cause of so much of my problems. Rather than making me more dependent on treatment chiropractors he has worked to get me into PT to build strength and to reduce my need for ongoing care. The only reason I am still a regular after almost 2 years is that just as I was going less often I was in a head on car collision and suffered soft tissue damage that set me back to worse than my first visit in 2009  BUT after just 6 months of weekly treatment and PT I am MUCH better and starting to return to regular activity levels. Beyond the physical help  both doctors have amazing bedside manner and are dedicated to patient care. My husband saw Dr. Minkowsky following being hit by a car and would not be walking today if not for the ongoing support and treatment he has had there. I cannot recommend them highly enough for back and orthopedic issues. My husband had a massive infection in the spine and was told he would likely never function as he did before  he was even told walking would always be painful  Dr. Minkowsky took a different view and worked with my husband to build a path to recovery.

While all three of us were on the phone together, my attorney told Dr. Minkowsky that we would need him to testify for me, since he was my treating doctor. His response was that he wouldn\'t do it, and that if we forced him to do so, he would tell the court that there was nothing wrong with me.I think if you hate testifying in court that much, then as a doctor you should be ethically bound to refuse personal injury andor worker\'s comp patients, or at least inform them that they cannot count on you to back them up if they need you in court.As I said this all took place many years ago, but if anyone reading this is in a legal situation, you would be well advised to verify whether Dr. Minkowsky has changed his position on courtroom appearances.'),(3017,270,5,'I couldn\'t agree more with what everyone has written about this practice & Dr Robert in particular.

Anyway, I would highly recommend Dr. Misra to anyone who is looking for a bright, caring, warm and thorough primary care physician to trust their own personal healthcare or for their family members.

I found Dr. Dye after another doctor scheduled me to have a lateral release surgery for a supposedly poor tracking patella. I began having doubts about the surgery, which cuts into the ligament to release the kneecap, after I learned it can ruin the knee for good. During the course of researching poor knee tracking I came across several medical articles, including Dr. Dyes\', that advocate nonsurgical treatment. Dr. Dyes\' approach, in particular, champions allowing the knee to rest so that the inflammation goes away and the cartilage strengthens. I\'ve started this more holistic treatment of resting and respecting my knees ability to heal and I\'m already starting to feel better.I highly recommend anyone with a knee problem to see Dr. Dye first.

I had surgery at Kaiser, my group health insurance at the time, with a very poor result. After changing my group health insurance, I was able to see Dr. Scott Dye. He is by far and away the best knee doctor in San Francisco. He gave me a very thorough exam the first time I met him. He took great care in assessing my knee and I could tell, unlike all the other orthopedists I have consulted about my knee, he really cared whether I got better or not. He was not quick to cut like most surgeons and he did not have blinders on, only looking for the surgical lesions, like most orthopedic surgeons do. He is the first knee doctor who took the time to evaluate my knee, gave me excellent advice, and has really helped me on the road to recovery.

He was in our insurance, close by, had great medical and Yelp reviews AND is a knee specialist. I\'ve now seen Dr. Dye for all my followup appointments over the last 4 12 months. Scheduling an appointment has always been easy, and he has never made me wait more than a few minutes to see him. Dr. Dye is clearly a brilliant man, but is able to communicate information and concepts in a way that is very clear for me to understand. His philosophy on the envelope of function makes absolute sense to me, and I\'ve applied it to other situations in my life as well. He also takes the time to answer my many questions during each visit.I have followed Dr. Dye\'s gentle approach to recovery, including PT and riding the stationary bike. The healing process for my injury is expected to take up to 18months, but I\'m happy to report that I\'m well on my way. I feel stronger and more comfortable every day.I also need to get give a shout out to the business side of Dr. Dye\'s office. I have emailed his assistant, Lesly, on multiple occasions requesting paperwork for work, the DMV, an airline ticket refund, etc and I have received the requested paperwork back, completed correctly and signed, incredibly fast. This really takes the stress out of an already stressful and daunting process. I have emailed Dr. Dye several times between visits with questions. He has also responded quickly with real answers to my questions. They have also submitted my insurance claims correctly.Dr. Dye is a great surgeon with a warm and competent staff. Thank you Dr. Dye for bringing me back from this serious injury. I am so pleased to have found you.'),(3051,272,5,'Scott Dye, MD really saved me with his gentle, healthy approach to treating knee injuries. Knees are his specialty. If you have been through the system like I have or if you\'d like to avoid it, you owe it to yourself to at least give Dye\'s approach a try. By the system I mean something like the years of ineffective PT and 3 surgeries I have gone through with my knee. My issue is poor tracking of the patella & resulting severe osteoarthritis. Until recently I was very active. I\'m 38. Several months ago, my knee became swollen & the swelling would not go away no matter how much I iced or rested. I could barely walk 3 blocks and my kneecap would painfully click sometimes. I saw 2 ortho doctors & they both suggested more surgery. Then I saw Dye.Dr. Dye\'s approach this is my interpretation is different from that of other ortho doctors, who generally think that the knee is a structure like a scaffold. If one part is broken, you fix that part. Dye thinks what the knee does is important, which is that it transfers force through the body. When it is being made to transfer more force than it can handle, it breaks down. If you stop that process, the body may be able to repair itself. So: if your knee is injured, rest is very important. Dye\'s prescription was this: extremely gentle PT, avoid overloading the knee stairs, hills, any cardio for now, steroid injection, rest, ice, NSAIDs. Dye emphasized that I could not let my knee swell so if anything caused swelling, I had to stop & rest. My PT at G Sports see my review did a great job at following the plan.The hardest part of this approach is of course rest. No cardio is a tough one for me and it took a heavy dose of willpower to handle that. I had to stop pushing myself to be active and start pushing myself to rest. But I have to tell you, it\'s working. After 2 months of this gentle program, my kneecap is tracking better than it has in...well, ever and the swelling is mostly gone. My knee is getting stronger and I\'m back on a stationary bike. What I love about this approach is that it\'s simple, it incorporates the body\'s own healing processes, and it is not harmful. Dye\'s goal is for your knee to heal & be functional. Other doctors want to fix you & if they can\'t they say, well we could do another surgery. Trust me: see Dye first.'),(3052,272,5,'I have been a patient of Dr. Dye\'s since 2000 when I fell on my knee.  It\'s not that my knee didn\'t get better and I still go to him; its because I always seems to do bad things to my knee and need to see a doctor periodically.  Dr. Dye has your best interest at heart. He approaches the healing method conservatively and truly believes that the knee will heal itself and he is more than happy to explain the problem in both layman\'s terms and scientific terms. And he\'s right; my knee has healed the many times I\'ve done things to it.  Although I never have had surgery by Dr. Dye, this is his last resort. And the couple of times when I\'ve done something to my knee he has never rushed me into surgery for which I am grateful.After a horrible knee surgery performed in Francenot by Dr. Dye, I had a problem and contacted Dr. Dye a couple of times after not having seen him for many years and he called me right back with with his opinion and advice.  Once I got back to the states, I saw Dr. Dye and he assured me that my knee will heal and that i have to treat it right and stay within the envelope meaning the functional capacity of the knee until it heals and gets back to working correctly.  He has always been there for me and has made room in his schedule to see me under urgent conditions.  He does his research and keeps up to date on all aspects of the knee. I don\'t know any other doctor who returns calls and is tentative to his patients as Dr. Dye.  I\'m just hoping that he doesn\'t retire anytime soon.'),(3053,272,5,'Dr. Dye has been spot on about just everything from the day I walked into his office. And he\'s been extremely cautious all the while. He readily acknowledged that there were no guarantees with my blown meniscus, which was breaking in pieces.  making it almost impossible for me to walk when I first entered his office in early 2012. Dr. Dye recommended surgery to repair the meniscus, so had it done in July of 2012. Now, two year later, my knee is completely pain free. I ride my bike 75100 miles a week, swim laps, and it feels like new. Just an awesome Job! Too bad it looks like I\'m going back in for another knee later this year.

To be clear, we have been a very highmaintenance patient family, yet through surgery, three appointments, well over a dozen phone calls, emails, and related needs, Dr. Dye consistently distinguished himself as a star in the field. He is a highly knowledgeable knee expert and skilled surgeon, to be sure. But he was also unlike most other doctors we\'ve encountered in that he proved genuinely kind, caring, and generous. I believe he has won recent awards for precisely this aspect of his practice and it makes sense. Even my physician brother was blown away by the level of concern and attention we received.The few negative reviews here are perplexing. I am a professional as well so perhaps I\'m sensitive, but to go online and unilaterally trash a respected surgeon over things like office decor, degrees, etc. on the wall which, BTW, are impressive, and subjective administrativeinsurance grievances  with no meaningful way for the provider to respond  strikes me as profoundly unfair. It\'s really the ugly side of Yelp and what caused me, a longtime lurker and user, to write my first review. The Davies campus at Cal Pacific might not be glamorous, but I would take highcompetence substance over gloss any day  and our family has fallen victim to the latter on a few occasions. For the record, we were were happy to comply with Dr. Dye\'s request to do xray, MRI and bone scan on site with the radiologists and other specialists he trusts and relies on. An erroneous or incomplete scanread could really make a difference so why not defer to the professional in question when it comes to something as significant as potential surgery?

I wrote a letter to his office questioning the bill. Shouldn\'t the followups be included with the cost of the original treatment? They answered that it is included but only for 2 months after the surgery. I explained that Dr. Dye\'s prescription for physical therapy lasted past 2 months and that he requested that I come in after for the followups.

When he reviewed my XRay he said it looked fine. The Dr. I saw after him showed me it actually show that my cartilage was flapping off and had a bony prominence. Somehow Dr. Dye missed this obvious thing. He also appears to be obsessed with Synovectomies and has a pet theory that most knee problems can be solved with this procedure. He presented me with some old articles where he did tests on himself to prove this theory. And not surprisingly he determined this is what I needed done. 4 other knee specialists did not agree with this assessment, and instead thought the large bone spurs visible were the issue.Also his office looks old, he has letters proudly displayed from the 1990\'s.

I explained the situation to Dr. Dye\'s office and they worked a miracle and got me in the next day. Dr. Dye explained everything he thought could be going on, ordered a xray and MRI and today  exactly 6 days later I met with him for followup and a plan of treatment.

Dr. Dye showed me the XRays and explained exactly what was happening with my knee. He then provided me with a handout which further detailed how the knee works. After reading the documentation he supplied I knew I was in the right hands. I took comfort that Dr. Dye used plain language and was confident in his words. He did not pressure me into taking any particular course of action and left it up to me to decide my treatment path.

Over the course of 2 years, he has seen 4 different orthopedic surgeons who treat college and professional sports teams, had 2 unnecessary surgeries that made his pain and debilitation worse, 1 exploratory surgery and prescribed physical therapy treatment that has been detrimental to his healing.  Finally, through a recommendation from a UCSD orthopedic surgeon we found Dr. Dye.  On the day we saw Dr. Dye, just prior to the appointment, my son saw an orthopedic surgeon at the Stanford Medical Center to get another opinion. After tests and examination, he recommended the same things the other doctors had, which wasn\'t helping him. Then we saw Dr. Dye. After his initial examination of my son\'s knee he explained the research he has done in his career and the revolutionary findings to understand knee pain and how to treat it. After reading about his work, it made so much sense to me.  Dr. Dye understands the cause of knee paint and his approach is much more natural, allowing the body to heal itself. The other doctors my son had seen were quick to say that surgery was needed to align the knee better, but that made things worse since that wasn\'t the cause of the pain. After Dr. Dye\'s diagnosis, following a bone scan, MRI and xrays, a minor surgery was needed due to the severity of the impingement to allow the knee tissue to heal. My son understands that it will take time to heal as Dr. Dye says, but he has more hope and confidence that this is the right treatment. It seems there are so many orthopedic surgeons out there doing unnecessary surgeries because they\'re operating from outdated teachings that don\'t get to the real cause of knee pain.

He told me that he had never worked on such a bad knee and that he did all he could do and that unfortunately I wouldn\'t be walking in 6 months, and then callously and coldly walked out of the room. He is the most blatantly unkind doctor I\'ve ever come acrossed and left me completely depressed and demoralized. A week later, I elected to go to another doctor for a 2nd opinion and more of a holisticnon invasive approach. This doctor was very caring and kind, and had a great bed side manner, unlike doctor Dye, whom obviously is more into this business for the money than the actual physical caring of his patients. The 2nd doctor recommend doing the Hyaloronan chicken cartilage injections3 sets, of which I did and I\'m still walking and have no incidences of the collapsing that I had previously and at least he gave me hope and and alternative, unlike Dr. Dye.. I wouldn\'t recommend Dr. Dye under any circumstances. I learned my lesson.'),(3075,272,5,'Dr. Dye operated on my knee 6 years ago. I was in PT for about 3 months. He is an incredible surgeon. He made time to explain everything in detail. All this was done on the same day that he was going on vacation but he made time for my family and I. This year I took my 86 year old mother for treatment and again he explained everything in detail and he saved her from knee replacement. In addition his front office is incredible. Ms. Leslie makes all the necessary calls to insurances, PT, XRAY etc. you don\'t have to worry bc its all covered. The office is Spanish bilingual and is located at the Davis Medical Center. We highly recommend him.'),(3076,272,5,'The Very Best!! Dr. Dye specializes in knee problems only.  I had a very unusual knee problem in that my knee was not centered. It caused my knee to dislocate and let me tell you, I have never experienced such pain and hope I don\'t ever again. I was able to live with it for many years but it finally became so bad that I had to address it. I had two choices: try to live with it by wearing a brace 247 and still have to very, very vigilant or have a surgical procedure which is not very common or well known. Dr. Dye completely explained Ihe pros and con in such way that I understood. I did research on Dye before making my decision and found that he was involved in creating this procedure which was very successful.. He has numerious awards and accolades for his pioneering successful procedures. I did not want to endure wearing a brace 247 and still have the possibily of dislocation. So, after doing my research, I was completely convinced that surgery was the way to go and that I could not be in better hands than with Dr. Dye. Of course I was nervous to have any kind of surgery but I was not worried that much about the procedure because of Dr. Dye. When I had questions or thought there may be something I should address after coming home, I could not believe how quickly Dr Dye got back to me every time.

He explained that it\'s hard to treat and that many surgeries are a waste of time. Eventually as the condition worsened he scoped my knee, despite it going well I overdid the rehab despite him being very clear I had to be ultra cautious. Long story short I had to have the same surgery on the other knee, 18mths later via Dr Dye I\'m still recovering and getting a course of synvisc injections. So far so good, things are improving.I\'ve read a lot about my knee problems and would 100% recommend Dr Dye, in fact I\'d be very nervous of going anywhere else. I trust him immensely. Listen to him when he says physio and keeping your knee within it\'s envelope of function is key, he knows what he\'s talking about. Don\'t expect long consultations pretty typical for all doctors but I\'d 100% recommend him, talking to pt and other physicians it\'s clear he is very well respected.

Fast, smart, friendly...knows her stuff.'),(3093,273,1,'I tried to see this doctor for a recurring yeast infection that\'s been going on for over a year. When I called to schedule an appointment the woman on the phone interrupted me and refused to listen to the rest of what I was saying. She just scheduled an appointment with a Nurse Practitioner. It was nice of them to try to schedule something right away but the Nurse Practitioner didn\'t have much time for me. I was having a lot of trouble with the pay by phone app to pay for parking which I had been having trouble resolving with the city for months. Due to this distraction she really shoved me out the door quickly and I never had a chance to talk to her about this being a recurring problem and how to deal with it going forward. All they did was just treat me for the infection I had that day. I was in agony for a month waiting to see a doctor to get to the bottom of it. I spent the better part of the day on Saturday researching the condition and found that there is more to treatment for a recurring yeast infection. I had to schedule another appointment to get my questions about this answered. My insurance forces me to pay everything out of pocket until I meet a $1,000 deductible per year. I was then told the first visit cost $165 and the second one cost $100. How the fuck does that cost $265? It\'s not like I had time to ask them before I had my appointment. For $165, they should take the time to treat you like a human being instead of a robot and they need to be humans too, not just robots. I should have time to get my questions answered THE FIRST TIME and not have to spend my Saturday researching my questions, that is what they get paid for. It\'s about time people in the health care profession start to figure out that they have to provide service for their exorbitant fees. If they didn\'t have time to see me, they should have schedule an appointment for me when they did have time if they are going to charge me $165.

Not only a great GYN, but also upbeat and caring.'),(3096,273,5,'I\'m 23, was sexually active and had never been to a gynecologist before and I\'m bracing myself for the judgement sure to come after writing this review. I guess I never went because though I differ from Samantha`s character on Sex in and the City in terms of sexual fluidity her fear of a routine checkup could mirror my own. There\'s one episode where she gets an AIDSHIV test and collapses for fear she\'d be taken into the little room where they tell you, yes you have it all but all in the form of what you never want to imagine. Me living to share my anxiety experience shows a few things: I did not die from embarrassment, my vagina monologues read happy and healthy and I have successfully overcome my childish fear of doctor visits all thanks to Dr. Milkman. She was most professional but well aware of my anxiety that at the time seemed uncontainable and she gradually eased me into the process. She was more than a professional, she was a woman with warm tones and a friendly demeanor as if to say hey I was once in your position, nervous for my gynecologist appointment, but it will pass and you will get in the habit of doing routine adult things. This professionalism transcended into an eliminated fear of doctors and dentists or any professional help for that matter. She was thorough, addressed my concerns with ample feedback after she asked an extensive list of questions ranging from family history, lifestyle habits etc etc. The establishment is maintained nicely. It is clean, spacious, devoted to hygiene and clearly run by germaphobes and victims of OCD. The building had large windows that let sunlight in and provided an opportunity to admire beautiful San Francisco from the fifth floor. Assuming this economy has a lot to do with the limited number of doctors accepting new patients, it was God send that after many failed attempts I had meandered into the loving arms of Bay Spring Medical. This is more than a review, it\'s a thank you.'),(3097,273,5,'In the past week, I\'ve had two appointments with Christy Collinson for a Paraguard IUD consultation and insertion. My entire experience could not have been any better. Mind you, I say this as someone who, mere hours ago, was having the *inside* of her nevercarriedababy uterus measured by this woman. Such experiences make me marvel all the more that the human population has reached the size it is. If this is what uterine measurement is like, I honestly do not want to know what labor and baby kicking feel like. And now that I have an IUD I won\'t need to!I got my Paraguard this morning. Christy was mercifully swift and gentle: if the entire actual process was a full five minutes by stopwatch I\'d be surprised. I went right to work and have been here all day with no problems and, magically, nary a cramp, though I expect they may make an appearance after the two morning Aleve I was told to take wear off.All of the front office and physician assistant service was well managed, polite and kindly. I got appointments with Christy quickly. Morning appointments were widely available, leaving most of my work day free, which I appreciate. During my IUD consultation, Christy answered all of my questions, did a thorough check of my medical history, walked me through everything, told me exactly what to expect and what the order of operations was, and gave me plenty of reading material.If you\'re considering an IUD, your insertion appointment will take place a few days into your period. It\'s easier on you that way because your uterus and cervix are softer and more open. Christy\'s schedule and front office know this and so it\'s not difficult to schedule, as it may sound. The evening before, you take one misoprostal to soften your cervix, and you take two Aleve or Advil in the morning before your appointment. All of this, together, works to make it easier, believe me. I had prepared myself for so much worse, and this was shorter than some of my pap smears. But don\'t read that the wrong way: Christy is careful and has never perforated a uterus, which with related infections is the source of most IUD issues women end up having. And the icing on the cake? For the first time, ever, no one here either assumed I want children or questioned me about why I don\'t, when I said I don\'t. My wishes were just respected right out of the gate. Amazing! It shouldn\'t be unusual, but it is.I\'ll update if I have any changes, but for now just couldn\'t be happier.'),(3098,273,5,'Yeah it\'s overshare to rate a doctor and even more a bits doctor but Doctor Milkman deserves it.I am so grateful I got to have her as my doctor.

She was very knowledgeable about LGBT populations. She also was very good with understanding what insurance companies would need and her staff was able to handle all the insurance issues without me having to get involved.Once I did have an exam she was able to schedule and perform surgery very quickly and called me during the weeks after to check up on me.

Yes, I really am Yelping a gynecologist...let\'s proceed. *Puts on glove and snaps it* I kid, I kid...Why am I really reviewing? Because the nurses who work here are all awesome and it\'s not easy finding a queerlesbian friendly gynecologist. Since I\'ve found such a great option, I feel compelled to share. Getting in the stirrups and spreading for the speculum is as unpleasant for me as it probably is for the person who has to do it. Unfortunately, it\'s a necessity for any woman who cares about her health. On the upside, this is something you only have to endure once a year if you\'re in good health. Unlike another female annoyance that visits once a month, I can force myself to do a once a year visit for an annual exam because it feels good to have the reassurance of knowing that all is well. Seeing as how the routine is so invasive, I prefer to go to a female gynecologist. The wonderful thing about this office is that almost all the staff is female. I did not see any men there at all. Everyone I interacted with, from the receptionist to the nurses, were all female and very friendly and professional. For any lesbians reading, I\'m sure some of you get slight anxiety when going to someone new and wondering if they\'ll be judgmental. Not a problem here. I answered the questions and did not feel any judgment from any of the nurses. They were professional and made me feel at ease. The office was very elegant and clean. The exam rooms were actually calming to be in. I don\'t like it when doctor\'s offices feel too clinical and cold. I felt at ease here. I did my annual physical with a nurse practitioner. If you want to see Dr. Milkman, be prepared to wait a very long time. Call ahead because she gets booked up months in advance. I called for an appointment with Dr. Milkman during the last week of February and the earliest available appointment I could get was in midMay. If you want to see Dr. Milkman directly, it looks like there\'s an approximately 2 month wait. TIP: If you just need something simple like getting a vaccine shot or your annual physical, the nurses here are very capable. The wait to get an appointment to see a nurse took 2 weeks for me. Specify on the phone that you\'re okay with seeing a nurse because they didn\'t offer that option to me until someone else suggested that I ask to see a nurse directly. Otherwise, they\'ll just leave you thinking you have to wait months to see someone, which is completely unacceptable if you have an emergency.

I spent the better part of the day calling offices, reading Yelp reviews, knocking some off the list bc of rude office staff, appointment availability several months out, ridiculously high boutique pricing and exclusionary practices..........UNTIL.....the stars aligned and I came to Dr. Milkman\'s name on the list with a rave review from my dear friend irl Susan T, who says she is so crazy about Dr. M. she wants to leap out of the stirrups and take her for a spin on the dance floor.

Further, her nursing team reflects her casual but competent style and kind, gentle and reassuring affect. I\'ve often booked appointments with a nurse for a quick checkin or followup. These nurses are kick ass, rock star medical practitioners.

I was left in the lurch without my medications and the only other doctor available was a man, which I was not comfortable with. Additionally since he hadn\'t seen me before he didn\'t feel comfortable writing my prescriptions and thus I had to come in again for another $200 doctor appointment. I became fed up with their lack of professionalism in communicating this change and left.

Her patience and compassion make the trek all the way to the mission worth it. The girls that work here are always sweet. Brenda makes my day every time I come in, she is so upbeat, caring, and professional. And Stephanie is amazing as well. She gets to know all the patients and remembers their names and greets them like old friends.

Dr. Adams\' knowledge of the relevant anatomy is superb, and she explains everything as we move from region to region, utilizing different techniques. Not only her skill, but her manner is to be praised as wellshe is warm and friendly, and knows how to make one comfortable and at ease when going through difficultyet importantexercises. Finding a therapist who helps your condition considerably but also whom you look *forward* to seeing each week is rare.The support staff of TCP is also great; very friendly, energetic, and easy to work with when it comes to makingchanging appointments. Almost all of them call me by name, even if I hadn\'t gotten to know theirs just yet; that they make an effort for that type of personal care is commendable and makes me feel more at home.One super tiny critical note would be that the iPad software used for checking in is sort of clunky and seems halffinished. But again, that\'s trivial. Also, it can get a bit loud with talking since most of the treatment area is only separated by curtains and the commonlobby area is right there. But this wouldn\'t be enough to affect the overall score.Overall: highly recommend finding a therapist here if you can.'),(3124,274,3,'All the people here were really nice and the place looked clean. I went in for a TB test for my CA teaching credentials. I was able to schedule an appointment for Thursday of that week  I believe I called on a Monday or Tuesday. Unfortunately, the doctor who administersreads TB tests is only there on certain days. TB tests need to be read between 2448 hours after being given. On Wednesday, I got a call saying it would have to be rescheduled until the following Tuesday because the doctor who reads the test is not in on Fridays and they\'re closed Saturday and Sunday  therefore it would not fit in the 2448 hour time frame. I think the girl who scheduled me was new, which is why she gave me TB appointment on a Thursday even though it\'s a policy that they don\'t administer them on Thursdays because of the time sensitivity. On Tuesday, I was late for my appointment and got bumped and they couldn\'t take me again until after I needed the test to be read because of scheduling and blah blah blah. They gave me some recommendations for other doctors close by who might be able to help though none were, so that was nice too. Also, the test was also only supposed to cost $40 here I ended up paying $100 to get it done at a place that could fit me in.So all in all, was a little disappointed because of scheduling inflexibility, but the people were as helpful as they could be.'),(3125,274,4,'My husband has been a patient of Dr. Ngo for awhile.

I went in for a new patient visit with Dr. Fatteh and sat in his office for 30 minutes before I was actually seen  no consideration for the patient\'s time. Secondly, during the consultation, Dr. Parvez Fatteh barely examined me and spent most of his time typing onto his laptop and was very impersonal. But that\'s not what the worst part of my visit, the worst part is when I contacted him the following day and had a couple of questions regarding my treatment. He was completely degrading, defaming and treated me unjustly insinuating that my concerns for my treatment were untruthful. I was completely appalled by his implication, that I told him I no longer want to be treated by him. There was a complete lack of respect on his part and I was in awe that after only one visit with his practice, that this doctor can be so insulting. Oh, and it doesn\'t stop there, I called the office to request a copy of my medical records which I was told was only 2 pages long by their staff, and was told they had to charge me $25 and I would have to pick them up from their office they would not mail the records to me. This is such an unreasonable and excessive fee for only 2 pages that I asked to speak to the doctor. I was then transferred to Dr. Anthony Ngo and have never been so appalled by the unprofessional and rude attitude exhibited by this person. I told him the fee is excessive and even believe that it was an attempt to be malicious since I had a negative experience with Dr. Fatteh and had discontinued my care with their practice. They made it extremely inconvenient and difficult to obtain my records, which is probably a HIPPA violation. I indicated to Dr. Ngo that I would file a complaint with HIPPA and that\'s when he questioned if I was \'threatening\' him. I told him he may be violating HIPPA rules and regulations regarding charging excessive fees for medical records and that\'s when he hung up on me! I have never experienced anything like this before  UNBELIEVABLE I attempted to call back the office and when I was transferred to him, he disconnected me again. This doctor is the most unprofessional man and I\'m amazed that he has the letters M.D.after his name. I have filed a complaint with the Office for Civil RIghts that enforce HIPPA Privacy Rule.

It seems strange to actually look forward to going to the doctor, but I truly do.

He is incredibly thorough and really up to speed on current medical research, always takes the time to go through my medical history and discuss any new physical or mental health issues I may be experiencing, and is incredibly easy to talk to regardless of how uncomfortable the topic might be.

She walked in with an attitude, stuck her hand in to check my cervix without much of a greeting, then proceeded to ARGUE with me that my OB could not possibly have told me that I would get an IV of antibiotics for GBS prior to my scheduled C because SHE is a licensed OB and knows these things.

He blatantly said, I am not concerned about it. He said inflammatory things about our other doctors and is overall a dangerous physician whom I wish I had never elected to see.

Go Dr. Turek. :'),(3173,277,5,'Dr Turek  \'The Miracle Worker!\'My wife and I are thrilled to share with you that we just welcomed our first baby boy! Cole was born on February 28th, 2012 weighing 8lbs 13oz and measuring 21.5 inches long. Both mommy and baby are doing great. Dr. Turek is an \'angel\' from God that performed a miracle for me and my growing family. A brief history: I went through a divorce 4 years ago that left me with two beautiful boys, and a vasectomy. Shortly afterwards, I met the love of my life. After dating for 11 months we got engaged and decided that we wanted children of our own so I called up my urologist the same one that performed the vasectomy and scheduled the surgery to have everything undone.He assured me that he has done this type of surgery before with enough success to have me commit to moving forward with him you would think the one that closed it up could open it back up....I was so wrong! The surgery was very painful, a lot of bruising and I had a huge hematoma that stretched from the top of my right hip bone down to the bottom of my buttocks. The recovery lasted two full weeks, I couldn\'t get off the couch for the first week because the pain and swelling was so horrendous. But I kept saying to myself that it will all be worth it if I can get viable sperm again. Needless to say, the surgery was unsuccessful and left me with residual amounts of pain, scaring, and a $7,500 bill to pay.My fianc and I were very disappointed and desperate to have the procedure done correctly. I went back to my doctor and expressed my deep concern of the outcome of the surgery and the only thing that he could recommend is that I should consult with Dr. Turek in San Fransico. Dr Turek specializes in fixing vasectomies that didn\'t take the first time. He\'s world renown, and has an impressive track record of successful outcomes. I just wish he would have referred me from the start vs trying to perform it himself and leaving me nothing to show for it but a lot of pain. So I took his advice and immediatly went on theturekclinic website. I was very impressed and immediately scheduled a consultation with Dr. Turek. I told him my story: 4 year old vasectomy, with an 8 month old failed vasectomy reversal. Dr Turek said, This is my area of expertise I like challenges so lets see what we can do. And after going over his success rates it was clear that he is the one that should have been doing this procedure from the very start. I had the surgery performed in January 2011, was married June 4th, 2011 and we had our first baby February 28th, 2012. What an amazing blessing to be celebrating our first wedding anniversary \'with\' our beautiful baby boy!There are three things that make Dr Turek the leader in this type of procedure: 1. Pain management It\'s amazing when the surgery is done correctly the first time how much \'less\' pain medicine is needed and how the recovery was expedited I had very little swelling and only had to use the pain medicine for two days. 2. After care is unparalleled. Dr. Turek is there from surgery all the way up to conception and his staff are amazing. Constant support and communication through: office visits, email and phone calls. 3. Positivity!Dr Turek\'s clinic gave my wife and I a feeling of hope and optimism from day one.We feel so blessed to have Dr. Turek in our lives and its amazing to think how gifted his talents are to bring life to parents when at one time there was no hope. He is our angel!Kind regards,Mike and Rachel'),(3174,277,5,'I went to see Dr. Turek about reversing a 10+ year old vasectomy.  We sat down and pored through data. We examined costs and risks of the procedure. We looked at data for the last several years. He showed me success and failure rates, and regression analysis showing the factors that affected success rate. Then we compared these same factors to my own medical history and proceeded with the surgery. The process was exactly as he said it would be, and all my decisionmaking was done with reams of medical data in front of me. The research he\'s compiled and published on success rates would be true of almost any other doctor I might have chosen to see. But Dr. Turek took the time to go through it all, explain all the terms to me, and never made me feel rushed. He\'s about as well published an expert in the field of male fertility as you might find, and an incredibly nice person as well.Even if you go for an initial consult which I did first before you make any decisions, it\'s well worth your time.[Update: we got pregnant within eight weeks][Update2: We have a beautiful 1 year old baby girl as a result of Dr. Turek work.]'),(3175,277,5,'I wanted to update to say that my husband and I have a second new baby.

The first was 6 12 months after my husband\'s surgery and the second was 18 months after his surgery. As I said in my previous review, 3 different highly esteemed Bay Area fertility specialists told us not to the do the surgery and that it would never work, that we\'d only get pregnant with their help. After several fruitless IUIs and doses of clomid, injectables, etc, we listened to Dr. Turek\'s advice and decided to fix the only known variable. After suffering for so long, we are no longer an infertile couple. He actually cured our problem. How many doctors are actually able to do that? To get to the root of a problem and fix it? I can\'t recommend Dr. T highly enough. Please go to him if you have any inkling that your fertility issues might be male factor. He will get to the root of your problem before throwing a 25k only option at you.'),(3176,277,1,'Our experience was exactly the opposite of Laney B.\'s. My husband went to Dr. Turek to consult about variococele, and he advised him not to bother treating it surgically, just sending us down the path of more IUIs and then IVF. Told us that his sperm were good enough and didn\'t do any testing. Later we did SCSA testing on our own and found out that they were 53% fragmented  um, that\'s hardly good enough!  Finally went to Werthman in LA for variococele repair, and Chris Kresser in Berkeley for nutritional assistance and between those two my husband finally has good sperm  no thanks to Dr. Turek who just caused us to lose a lot of time, and hundreds of dollars for the useless consultation with him.'),(3177,277,5,'I have been married for 4 years. Two years ago I and my wife started trying to conceive, but it wasn\'t happening. After a year of unsuccessful tries we decided to look for help. We visited our primary care physician Dr. Alla Boykoff who recommended that both of us should undergo different tests to determine where the problem was.I was taken by complete surprise to find out that my sperm count was very low  insufficient to conceive under normal conditions the traditional way. On the other side the good news was that my wife was completely fine. It was determined that the problem was with my low sperm count.My primary care physician referred me to Dr. Ira Sharlip who was in my network Aetna HMO. I went to see doctor Sharlip and after a 30 minutes wait I was invited to his office. He actually let his assistant examine me. She determined that I had Varicocele. Dr Sharlip told me that I may consider surgery, but that the chances of improvement are not high. He sounded like this surgery will probably not resolve the problem. Considering his opinion my primary care physician recommended that we visit Pacific Fertility Center and ask them for help. So we did. After a lot of blood tests my wife had her first IUI  this was our first attempt to conceive using this method. It was not successful. So were the next two we did. Our doctor at Pacific Fertility center recommended my wife to start a hormone therapy and increase the IUI attempts to 2 per month. At that point last summer we decided to continue with the second set of IUI\'s after we come back from vacation. While on vacation in Bulgaria my home country I decided to go see a specialist urologist and ask for second opinion. The doctor confirmed Dr. Sharlip\'s diagnosis. However, he insisted that I performed the surgery to treat the Varicocele. He was convinced that after the surgery my sperm count will significantly improve and with the help of Chlomid it will be boosted to even higher levels. He said that I need to make sure that I do everything to fix the problem and only if unsuccessful move to artificial insemination.Since I live in San Francisco, I decided to find the best doctor in the area who can perform the surgery. I found that Dr. Paul Turek specializes in infertility issues in men and has his own clinic. All his reviews were great. I called his office and scheduled an appointment. I was met promptly by the doctor and we had a 40 min conversation. I was able to discuss my problem in great detail. Dr. Turek listened carefully and then examined me. He also confirmed the Varicocele and recommended a surgery. He also convinced me by showing me several scientific papers that he had published with actual data on the success rate of improving semen analysis and most importantly successful pregnancies after undergoing such surgery. From the data it was evident that I should expect my wife to become pregnant 68 months after the surgery. So I was determined and convinced to have this surgery. What also helped was that my new PPO insurance with Aetna was covering it unlike the expensive IUI and IVF procedures at the Pacific Fertility Center. I had the surgery this past October. It lasted only couple hours and by lunch time I was on my way home. In January 2011 I visited Dr. Turek\'s office for sperm analysis and examination. My sperm count had improved significantly. This gave me great hope that the surgery might have fixed the problem. And now to the great news: two months later just before my next appointment with Dr. Turek my wife found out that she was pregnant. I was so happy. She is currently in her 9th week and we both hope that everything will go well in the future. I can\'t explain how thankful I am to Dr. Turek. He was absolutely right that after the surgery we will not need to visit Pacific Fertility Center anymore. I recommend to all men with a problem like mine to consider this treatment. It probably will save you a lot of suffering and expenses.'),(3178,277,5,'This one\'s simple. Couldn\'t recommend someone more highly. Obviously, no matter why you go to Dr. Turek, it\'s a sensitive topic. The office is modern and comfortable. The staff was *phenomenal*. Read my posts, and you\'ll see how much I appreciate or notice missing good customer service. The main woman who handled my paperwork and what not prior to visiting the office was GREAT, pleasant, understanding, and accommodating.Then I met Dr. Turek. Now, when you\'re dealing with a doctor like Turek, you\'d like to be confident he knows what he\'s doing. I\'ve met SO MANY doctor\'s I didn\'t trust as far as I could throw a stick. Dr. Turek knows his stuff inside and out. Answered ALL my questions. and what initially attracted me to his practice during a web search were his stats. He offers his stats how effective he\'s been in the past. NOWHERE ELSE did I find a doctor who listed his stats. And when I looked up the average effectiveness, Turek\'s numbers were well over 2x more effective. TWICE. not 15%, but TWICE. and when we talked in his office, he said something like, Oh yeah, well I need to update the site. Those numbers are old and even better now.!!!!Turek knows his stuff and will give you the best care you can receive ANYWHERE in the bay area my *humble* opinion :'),(3179,277,5,'We are feeling quite blessed and filled with gratitude that our journey to conceive brought us to Dr. Turek\'s clinic.

He is also surrounded by a wonderful and talented staff.Anyone weighing the options of pursuing IVF treatments versus a vasectomy reversal or redo, should look no further. I had my vasectomy about 10 years ago and my first reversal nearly five years ago on the east coast, which initially worked, but did not last due to flaws and limitations used in that procedure. Dr. Turek explained why my earlier procedure did not last and reviewed in detail his own techniques and successes with us. It is quite obvious that he enjoys what he does and that he has become a pioneer in addressing male fertility issues. His attention to detail and desire to provide the best level of service possible has lead him to seek out the best staff, facilities, and techniques in the field.We are very pleased to announce that we are now one of Dr. Turek\'s many success, conceiving just 3 12 weeks post surgery!

Great bedside manner. An excellent resource.  Highly recommended.'),(3182,277,3,'I saw Dr. Turek for variocele repair. He and his staff were extremely professional. I am writing this review mostly for those men out there who have intermittent aching in their testicles, have a variocele, and also have NO significant decrease in sperm count or sperm motilitymorphology. I decided to have my variocele repaired in the hope that my mild aching would go away and also in the minor hope that it would improve my overall testicular healthalthough according to my labs my testicular health was fine. Another motivating factor for me to have the surgery was that I recently had undergone some severe testicular pain that sent me to the ER. Possibly this was due an ischemic episode or an infection, nobody really knew, but it did pass and also motivated me to have the surgery. Ok, here is my point, for me, since infertility was not an issue, this surgery was 100% elective. So, the surgery was performed, Dr. Turek ligated many enlarged veins 14 with some having a diameter of 5+ mm. In the end, the surgery failed. I can not blame Dr. Turek for this, as it is known that some surgeries fail for unknown reasons, probably as my enlarged veins shrunk in size, other veins grew in size to keep the size of my variocele relatively constant I also continue to have intermittent aching. So, nothing has chanced, except I am ~$3.5K poorer for the experience at least nothing got worse. My only complaint about Dr. Turek was that during the 6 month postop exam, he was adamant that the size of the variocele had shrunk and that probably the reason for the enlarged veins was residual inflammation. He suggested I go on a long course of Ibuprofen. These last moments caused me to lose some respect for Dr. Turek, as I would have preferred he just told me that I was in the minority who experience a failed variocele repair. So, the moral of the story, if you don\'t have infertility issues, but you do have mild testicular pain, I would recommend not having the surgery. If you do have fertility issues, low sperm count, bad morphology, etc, I would recommend Dr. Turek. Presumably since he specializes in this, your chances with him are as good as anywhere else.'),(3183,278,5,'Dr. Tiltmann is the real deal. Quite easily one of the most amazing practitioners I\'ve ever met. I\'ve seen him off and on since 2009 for various issues he has successfully, almost magically resolved for me  plantar fasciitis, a painfully torqued rib, disabling low back  sacroiliac pain, and most recently, a severe soft tissue injury to the rhomboid, paraspinal muscles of my upper back. With each injury I found myself overwhelmed with intense, crippling pain and decreased mobility, wondering how long it would take for me to feel better. But it is the wonderful and inspiring combination of competence, expertise, knowledge, and compassion that reminds me each time that I am in the very best hands when I walk into his office. I went to see Dr. Tiltmann last Wednesday for my upper back injury. I was in such excruciating pain that I could barely breathe without moaning in agony. I could not sit, walk, or even lie down without exacerbating my symptoms. As usual, Dr. Tiltmann took all the time to sit down with me, patiently listening to my symptoms and concerns and gathering all the information he needed. He described in great detail what had happened and explained exactly how he was going to address the problem. After just two sessions one on Wednesday and another on Friday, my pain is significantly reduced. His powerful combination of chiropractic adjustment along with the Graston Technique is markedly effective for even the most acute musculoskeletal woes. Dr. Tiltmann is extremely knowledgeable, skilled, and an expert in his field. His bedside manner makes your feel genuinely cared for and confident that you are being treated by someone who really knows his stuff. He takes the time to map out a treatment plan, teaches you about anatomy, and provides guidance that sticks with you.

I am more than happy to have visited Dr. Tiltmann. It was clear from the beginning that he is focused on tackling the cause of pain, rather than its mere symptoms. He told me to send him pictures of my office set up and he said he\'d give me feedback on what\'s good and not good ergonomically. He is a certified ergonomist in addition to a chiropractor. This is the kind of careconsultation that I have been looking for: getting the cause of the problem. He also taught me a set of exercises with a tube, which helps build my muscles. They have a separate exercise room where you practice the assigned exercise before you see Dr. Tiltmann every time you go there.

I\'d seen two physical therapists before, including one who could direct bill my insurance. Both of them gave me tons of exercises which I did religiously, but neither of them could solve my problem. Every time I would resume running at distance, horrible pain would return 12 days after my runs. A knowledgeable friend a runner and competitive volleyball player guessed from my symptoms that scar tissue was to blame, and I could feel as much along my achilles. So I searched Yelp for someone who could work on scar tissue and I found Dr. Blum, who does Graston technique and Active Release Therapy ART.Now wait a minute, I\'m giving up on traditional, insurancesupported physical therapy and seeking a chiropractor  just because Yelpers like her, and because my smart friend and I had a hunch about scar tissue?That\'s exactly what I\'m saying.I came in for a visit and Dr. Blum took my issues very seriously. She listened to what was going on, checked me out, and agreed on the scar tissue thing. She also recommended a rather different course of treatment, which I doubted at first... but as I mentioned, I was desperate. So we did: Two sessions per week of Graston and ART for four weeks, then one session per week for another month.  I would only start running after she said it was OK I would take two days off after every run not one I would cease doing 90% of the exercises the other PTs had me do. Instead, I would only do two: foam roller on my achilles and calf, and reverse toe raises. I would do these exercises every day.It worked miracles. After two months, I was back to running 10+ miles without achilles pain. Now I should say that this didn\'t come cheap, and I did have to dance around some insurance paperwork. The Graston had an additional $50 copayment per session, in addition to my insurance company\'s $25 deductible. Also, I had to fill out forms just right to make sure my insurance company would keep paying for treatment. Ultimately, I saved them money in the long run by getting my problem solved.And yes, it was worth it.

She was friendly and helpful with answering questions, however my ailments did not improve much, but that is not why I am writing this review.I eventually had to change insurance providers and I provided my new insurance information to the front desk and they said they would take a look and see if my my insurance covers the treatments. After 3 weeks and 3 treatments they told me that my insurance did not cover chiropractic work. Then they proceed to charge me their walking rate of $80 an hour for all 3 visits. I complained and argued that I would pay the $80 for the first session, but should receive some sort of discount of the following two, but they disagreed. They gave some BS excuse that the insurance companies would not allow that and persisted to call and send invoices. Bare in mind I have already paid my normal copay rate per session up till then. Finally after several phone calls I asked to speak to Dr. Blum who worked on me to discuss the outstanding balance. After speaking to her and trying to come to a reasonable conclusion for about 20 min without any resolution and a bit of an argument, they charged me an additional fee for speaking to her about the balance because I was using up her billable hours when she had no client. This was the most ridiculous exchange ever! Lastly I spoke with Dr. Tiltmann expecting a reasonable end since he is the owner and he just went off and threatened me with taking me to collections in a very aggressive and confrontational manner. In the end I just paid because I didn\'t want to deal with collection and poor credit. It was a little over $100 that we are talking about, however it was about the principle. I have run several businesses in my life and have dealt with all sorts of people. This was by far the worst customer service I have ever encountered in my life. If you want to try this place, just make sure all you insurance is in order so that everything works seamlessly because once there is an issue or hiccup you will get screwed by completely unreasonable people.'),(3198,278,5,'I\'ve been to so many doctors, chiropractors and physical therapists, and Dr. Blum is the best!

Dr. Tiltmann was incharge for her and I must say he has a really patient outlook, when it comes to explaining the effect and impact of each exercise.

He basically helped me to resolve an odd muscle issue that I have been dealing with for a couple of years.Basically I got pain and clenching in one side of my jaw whenever I drank caffeine maybe due to its musclestimulating effects? who knows...I thought I had TMJ and may have to have surgery, but thankfully I went to Dr. Tiltman first.He used the Graston massage technique on my face, some exercises and \'alignments\' as he calls them, and that weird issue was totally gone by visit 2! The doc said that if I wrote a review to mention that such a complete and rapid resolution of an issue is pretty unusual, so consider this my disclaimer. But I\'m not complaining.The fact that a massage cured me made me think that the issue was really a sensitivity to caffeine combined with an imbalance of muscle tone, probably due to habitual chewing on one side. Since then, I use some simple yoga facial exercises to maintain muscle balance and remove tension in my face. Doing these exercises daily is correcting the imbalance and I can drink tea again with no issues.If being effective isn\'t enough, he has a great bedside manner and is a pleasure to work with. And that Graston massage feels great.

So jumped on different chiropractors until I found FDC I think late 2013 and met Dr. Kris Blum. What can I say  she fixed all my issues; shoulder impingement, back strain, knee problems due to quad tendinitis, traps issues, etc. She is my go to doctor My primary physician with my health care know nothing about my sport and just prescribe pills to me all the time. Dr. Blum\'s ART and Graston treatments never fail to fix my issues. Based from what I read on Yelp, I think most patients who come here have been on the running sport or marathons. I came in here with a different background where I deal with mostly high intensity, high volume competitive weightlifting and beats my body over and over. I needed help most of the time to keep me in the right shape to perform in my sport. Dr. Blum is very knowledgeable, patient and understands my concerns.

I have to say that Dr. Kai Tiltmann is the best. He takes the time to listen to your issues and comes up with a treatment plan that is tailor made for you. I like his conservation approach. Some chiroprators just want to just give you a bunch of adjustments and that is it. He sometimes uses the Graston Technique which is an instrument for sports injuries. It\'s amazing!

After a traumatic wisdom teeth extraction in 2007, I developed a chronic tension headache that lasted for nearly 6 years. During that time, facial movements such as smiling and laughing were strained and would worsen the pain. Initial treatments from a TMJ specialist and a prescribed mouth guard did little to reduce the pain although the mouth guard does prevent muscle activation during sleep. I finally found relief in chiropractic and trigger point therapy. Dr. Tiltmann\'s recognition and treatment of the hypertonicity in my back was spot on. By applying the Graston technique to my back and TM regions, Dr. Tiltmann significantly reduced tension in my back and head from the very first visit. Afterwards, my tension headache episodes dropped virtually to zero.Dr. Tiltmann\'s organization, professionalism, care and efficiency is impressive. After a speedy and accurate diagnosis of my condition, we had a concrete and comprehensive game plan  graston technique, chiro adjustments, prescribed back exercises, ergonomic adjustment of workspace, TMD self education materials. After the first visit, Dr. T went the extra mile and called to see if I had any questions or concerns.

The treatment showed results quickly; I felt the lift in pain after the first session. But beyond the treatment, he examined the rootcause of the problem and prescribed exercise routines and posture corrections to sustain the wellness. Of course, any healing requires care and exercise from the patient as well, and I felt that his practice promotes this concept rather than grabbing in patients for more treatment .I think his wide pursuit of physical activities and openmindedness towards other remedies helps better connect with patients and also make the appropriate lifestyle adjustments to avoid the recurrence of the pain.

And has tried numerous ways to get me to remove my review. Why is he so concerned about one review? I am only writing this review because I don\'t want anyone else to have to go through the EXTREMELY NEGATIVE experience I had.I have answered Dr. Tiltmanns questions about my initial review below:If you truly felt that way, why did you return 14 more times? We have a 100% patient guarantee. If you are unhappy with your first visit. Walk awayno charge.When a person is injured you want to believe your medical caregiver really has your best interest at heart. However after a few sessions, I felt trapped. I couldn\'t afford to start over with someone new. We never tell anyone that, as we are unsure if the insurance will pay. Remember, verification of benefits is no guarantee of payment. I was told my insurance covered at least 12 visits.Your treatment started in January 2013 and ended in April 2013, but you did not provide a signed lien until the end of May 2013, even though your attorney was retained in December 2012. Correct, we did not accept the lien at that time. A lien agreement was sent to my attorney on May 19 of this year. Financial District Chiropractic threatened to withhold my medical records unless I signed a lien for the remaining balance I owed them.The amount you paid per visit was $74.50. In total including my insurance payments I paid $1608.00. This amounts to $107.50 per visit. It seems I was overcharged $32.80 per visit, and may be entitled to a refund of $492.00.We submit billing 3xweek. Often we have to wait 48 weeks for the insurance company to process the claim and send the explanation of benefits. We also don\'t know what all the other treatments you are getting outside of our office that might affect your coverage. We notify our patient right away once an EOB is received with denied coverage. Dr. Blum was well aware of all the other doctors I saw. She was the one who suggested I go to see a podiatrist and orthopedic surgeon who suggested I go to physical therapy along with the chiropractor. Financial District Chiropractic was the one who referred me to GSports Physical therapy.If you want to discuss your issues, I will be happy to do so. Feel free to call the office or come and speak with me personally.I have nothing to discuss, I just do not appreciate being threatened for expressing my experience on a public forum. Yes, I will protect my business from libel and defamation of character as would any business that felt they have been wronged. Wouldn\'t you? Have your read some of the other reviews?

The pain of that motion was excruciating. 8 sessions of Active Release and Graston interrupted by a vacation had me to about 90% ... I was amazed. She then did a full reevaluation so as NOT to keep me coming back if we didn\'t feel there was more to gain. We agreed another few sessions, spaced further apart, would be worthwhile ... and got to around 95%, a completely acceptable point!

Even when I didn\'t have the cramp, the stiffness had been preventing me from taking deep breaths, and I walked away breathing deeply  like a fish back in water, I guess.After six visits in three weeks, I can say that I haven\'t had the severe cramp return, and the stiffness is gone. I do feel a twinge now and then, but I\'m exercising my back as instructed, I\'ve adjusted my workstation as advised, and I\'m being careful how I lift things.

He also asked and listened when I said I wasn\'t sure I wanted the back cracking, etc as this was new to me. I was grateful that I didn\'t feel pressured to go in directions that concerned me. I\'ve had great results after 4 sessions. It\'s been a big relief to not have the pain anymore I actually didn\'t realize how much it was slowing me down.

About Graston: I was slightly freaked out after the first treatment, because my back was really red and I experienced a little bruising.

Now I\'m hooked.'),(3219,278,5,'This review is specifically for Dr. Kris Blum and her awesome healing powers! I met her at a free ART session through my half marathon training group in 2010, and luckily for me she was there on the day I injured myself nine miles into a ten mile run. I believe this was three weeks before my very first half, and I was incredibly worried I wasn\'t going to get to run in the race. She used ART and graston as well as some minor adjustments for a few follow up sessions, and my sprained hip flexor was almost 100% when I ran. She also gave me a lot of emotional support, which really helped me feel confident about running. Anyone running their first half can understand you have a lot of concerns beforehand, and that\'s if you are healthy!Since then, she\'s fixed a sprained lower back and glute injury, a really bad ankle sprain, and a minor hamstring pull. When I badly sprained my ankle last year, I hadn\'t even thought of going to her for ARTGraston. I have sprained my ankles many times before, and have always just done the standard PT work. A friend who was also seeing her at the time just happened to mention the injury, and Dr. Blum suggested I come by. I won\'t say that she is a miracle worker, but she had me running 12 miles in a 186 mile relay only 8 weeks after seriously spraining three tendons. Yes, I was taped, and yes I was still a little swollen, but my ankle was strong, and painfree, and I was able to run the whole time. And now, six months later, I have zero pain or weakness. I truly feel that the soft tissue work also reduced the scar tissue from old injuries, and my ankle is much stronger than before.Since I have Kaiser, I pretty much pay out of pocket, although she gives a discount if you are a member of PacWest. She doesn\'t push for a lot of visits, and I feel the number of visits is reasonable for what she needs to do. The cost CAN add up, but I want to continue being active, and I\'d rather pay for quality and get the best treatment with the least amount of downtime.Other things to notethe office and exam rooms are really nice and convenient to get to, and the staff is very friendly both on the phone and in person. I\'ve never had a problem getting in within a couple of days. Dr. Blum has always been good about providing information on length of treatment and making sure my questions were answered. She also has given me strengthening exercise with each specific injury, and that has helped me prevent furtherfuture problems.I basically have stopped going to my regular doctor for sports injuries because I know I\'ll just end up getting a second opinion from Dr. Blum. She deserves more than a five star rating!'),(3220,278,5,'I would like to add my 1,000 stars to the long list of perfect reviews of Dr. Blum. She is absolutely amazing!

I ended up paying $25 copay for each visit and $371 in residual charges for six visits, for a total of $521 out of pocket. Each visit was billed at $245.00 the initial consultation was higher and included some spinal manipulations and physical therapy.  Insurance providers treat each differently, since each procedure has a different code which then submitted to your insurance provider. Going in, I would have appreciated greater visibility like a spa menu into what procedures I was being charged for, along with the corresponding billing code, so that I could check with my insurance company to understand EXACTLY what was covered and what was not covered.'),(3222,278,5,'So far, Dr. Blum has fixed some lower back and knee issues that I was having.

When I found a doctor in the east bay, I called Dr Maybury\'s office to request my medical records. The person who answered the phone was gruff and cut me off several times. I made my request, with her talking over and interrupting me several times  she put me on hold for 30 seconds and came back on the line to tell me the office did not have my records. She was NOT helpful, extremely rude and a poor listener. Because I am a cancer survivor and my medical records are extremely important in assessing my care, I asked her to please look again  she refused and said No, your records are not here. I can\'t help you. I went ahead and kept my new doctor appointment with another physician. I filled out a release for my medical records to be sent from Dr Maybury\'s office to my new doctor.

The Breast Health Center informed me of abnormal findings which prompted the need for surgery. I was so impressed with Nima who far exceeded my expectations in each and every way.First of all, service is topnotch. Prior to my scheduled appointment, all forms are conveniently delivered to my email\'s Inbox to complete at my leisure. Nima\'s staff is not only warm, welcoming, and courteous, but also knowledgeable, helpful, and professional. Wait time in the office for your appointment is minimal, if at all. I was even seen earlier than scheduled. Exam rooms are neat, comfortable, spacious, and modernly equipped with computers. I was even given the nice, soft cotton gowns to change in to. The scheduling process for the surgery is well organized and efficient. I left my initial consultation visit with surgery scheduled for the following week, a followup appointment in hand, and an informational folder with everything I needed to know about the surgery and what to expect after the procedure . . . Very well detailed and clearly written I would have to say! I felt well prepared. What excellent service!If there\'s one person who definitely chose the right path in life, it is certainly Nima Grissom. She is such a phenomenal surgeon and her reputation among numerous healthcare professionals is outstanding. Nima\'s surgical talents are unparalleled as her work, which she performs with such precision and finesse, is exquisite!Having been a frequent flyer to the operating room, I was familiar with the surgery process, especially the aftermath. Lo and behold! This experience was like no other . . . I was out of that OR in no time, I had no postsurgical pain and the breast looked untouched! No swelling, no bruising, no scarring and no deformity . . . A very positive cosmetic outcome! With the way Nima makes the incision along the curve of the areola, it\'s barely noticeable. It was as if I never had surgery! Was it all a dream??? . . . Artistry at its finest!Yes, Nima is good, VERY GOOD!!! She is an outstanding physician whose priority is patient care, and it shows in her great bedside manner.Nima\'s qualities, demeanor and mannerism are exceptional. She is very genuine and her degree of sincerity, concern, understanding, guidance, and support reflects the kind, caring, and compassionate person that she is. Her gentle calmness and encouraging, comforting nature put me at ease during a time of such heightened anxiety.

She is very downtoearth and I appreciate her frank, nononsense approach. Her playful teasing and quickwitted sense of humor are quite entertaining and keep a smile on my face. Like a saint, Nima patiently listens to your questions and concerns, and responds in a nonjudgmental manner which is clear, concise, easy to understand, and, most importantly, puts you at ease.

She follows through on any requests you may have and what she says she will do. St. Nima herself also calls you to check on how you\'re doing from the surgery, and informs you of labtest results as soon as she receives them. Also, with my postsurgery followup appointment, I was scheduled with a different staff provider, but yet Nima still took the time and effort to pop in to see how things were going and to wish me well . . . A very special personal touch! Nima, thank you so much for all you do! . . . Much appreciated!Allison, the Nurse Practitioner, is another superstar.

I have been thinking of getting Botox treatment for my forehead for some time. When I mentioned to him before, he didn\'t think it was that bad, and that I could wait !. To me, he thinks carefully about what I actually need. There certainly will be fewer Botox horror stories on tabloids if the world has more of this kind of cosmetic surgeons who can and will give good professional unbiased feedback. 2 He is an artist  I finally did Botox my forehead this time, and in addition, adding some volume to my cheek using Voluma. What can I say? It took him only 5 minutes to turn back my clock by 7 years!!!

However since learned he charges unreasonable prices for fillers which is a bit unsettling because you have to return so frequently and I never got the results I wanted, I had to pay for him to fill deep pockets he created as his mistakes. His prices are also so high now at $879 per syringe, you could seriously fly to LA and have it done right the first time from a reputable doctor. Which I\'m now doing if Dr. welsh doesn\'t work out. The office isn\'t fancy like others I\'ve seen which is minus a star because we know this isn\'t factored into the cost... and he is always saying he\'s perfecting his technique or trying something new. A little scary but then again fillers could be considered an innovative field. After spending $2,500 on fillers for my on just my under eyes and lips, he was still unable to give me the lips I wanted unfortunately. The under eyes were okay. He inflated my mid face which was unnecessary, but because of his mistake which I paid over $700 for him to fix.  My top lip dissolved within a month after two chances. So did the effects to my left eye and I feel that I had too much filler placed overall for my age... Also, in my second visit ... my check up he filled in deep pockets in my midface to overcompensate for pockets he made when doing my under eyes during the first procedure and charged me for his mistake. This check up he treated as a second procedure and just started to inject me with one than two syringes of restalyne without consultation or talk of how much this would cost, if anything. I was very nervous and no idea how much was being used. I thought this was at his cost if anything for not getting it right in the first place and creating the deep pockets in my midface. However, after the procedure I was completely caught off guard when the receptionist showed me something higher than my rent payment on a calculator when leaving the office. I brought the high charges of $2,000 to her and she says, sometimes he can\'t fit it all in one surgery so he has to do two, and then I asked .... then why did he and you say come in two weeks for a check up to take some photos? You guys should call it a second procedure and provide a [follow up] quote. What is my wallet supposed to do then when he starts injecting me again? Print cash? I have money, but I don\'t spend it like that. Also, why should I have to pay for something I\'m unhappy with in the first place? Re: his work creating deep pockets in my face? The whole thing was very confusing. I would continue going to Dr. Mabrie if I felt more like a customer vs someone he was trying to squeeze cash out of. He just raised his prices so it\'s probably no chance of me going back now whatsoever when I\'m seeing quotes from other offices in $650 range that are highly recommended by friends who look great ps. My recommendation:The office will give you a little sheet with their pricing your first visit or randomly, but after that they won\'t put together a plan of how much things will cost with you and work at it over time. Make sure you ask for a quote before he does ANY work, and then again for your check up this was my only mistake that I wish I would have done the 34 times I went in. Otherwise they assume you have a few grand in your bank account and willing to dish out whatever is needed to cover the cost of your sagging face! LOL. His prices just went up to 875$ per syringe of restalyne wholesale cost for a syringe is in the low hundreds. I would make sure you get a few quotes to ensure you feel comfortable with the pricing and if you want Hollywood lips, he\'s on the conservative side and his technique isn\'t quite there so I\'d recommend trying elsewhere. Also, remember to get a QUOTE previous in hand regarding the pricing so you aren\'t blown away with a 2,000 bill you aren\'t prepared for like I was. Good luck!'),(3271,281,3,'I am not a big reviewer in general, but since this is such a hard subject to research, we have to rely on online reviews, I spent a lot of time on Real Self and here, debating whether or not to get Restylane under my eyes. I\'ve done botox for a few years, but really felt like my face needed something more.So is this a review of Restylane or Dr Mabrie? I\'m not sure, but I had such a dramatic reaction to the product: super swollen eyes, bruising on both eyes, at least a week with sunglasses or glasses to cover my face and just weird, swollen lumps under my eyes after that. I emailed the office at two weeks to say how unhappy I was, with no reply. At about a month after the procedure, I came back into the office to talk to the Dr about my results, he agreed that there were issues, the product was uneven and there was a weird lump. He offered to fix it by taking some Restylane out using hyaluronidase, and to put more Restylane to even it out. After some research, I found that the hyaluronidase can also affect your natural collagen, dissolving that as well. And since I had such a terrible reaction in the first place, I just couldn\'t stomach having more put in. So I cancelled the appointment. His staff is clueless and short, they have no idea how delicate this business is, how important it is to treat each patient with kid gloves, especially when there have been mistakes made. I appreciate that Dr Mabrie was able to discuss the problems with me, but I\'m only dealing with him in person, when I called to cancel his staff acted like I was rude to want to talk about why. Now I am left to just wait it out, eventually the product will be absorbed into my body, but it does swell up still and while it\'s not completely noticeable, it\'s made me look much worse. I don\'t know what the take away from this is, but maybe love your looks and wait to get a face lift at 50? Fillers are fickle and it\'s impossible to know how your body will react to them.'),(3272,281,2,'I wanted a refreshed look for my birthday and made an effort to schedule Dr. Mabrie several weeks before, so any bruising or swelling from fillers would be gone in time. Nicole from his office was very sweet and did her best to accommodate me, including splitting my consultation and treatment to fit into little windows of time in the doctor\'s schedule. I had looked into Dr. Mabrie for quite some time now and was impressed by his photo gallery on the website. I still think he probably would\'ve given me a great look for my birthday. Unfortunately, I may never find out.For my first consultation, I made sure to leave from home with plenty of time, so I would not be late. I was the second appointment of the day, but since the lady ahead of me was running late, they offered to take me in first if I could arrive early. I did arrive early, but actually, they didn\'t get me in until my actual appointment time even without a patient ahead of me. Whatever. I was just happy to be seen on time.However, on treatment day, I arrived about 45 minutes early unpredictable traffic, so I made sure I wouldn\'t be late by leaving well in advance. Dr. Mabrie charges $165 if you don\'t cancel before 2 business days. I\'m thinking because he feels his time is important. That\'s fine. I can respect that. But then as a private paying patient, I also expect my time to be respected, especially when Dr. Mabrie\'s prices are well above average charging $875 per syringe of Restalyne. When I arrived, I saw two other women in the waiting room. 15 minutes before my appointment, we were all still waiting. I had to ask Christa how Dr. Mabrie was doing on time. She did go check on him but otherwise acted like it wasn\'t her problem. And I guess it\'s not. It\'s solely my problem.A few minutes before my appointment, he finally came out and called in the first of two ladies ahead of me. She was a consultation only and was expected to be around 15 min. I would say she took about 20 my own consultation was under 15. Now it\'s 1520 minutes past my appointment time, and I still had another lady ahead of me who was actually getting treatment, not a consultation. I let Christa know that while I\'m not trying to be difficult, I can\'t wait beyond 11:30 as I have other things planned. She let Dr. Mabrie know, but again, it was just a He apologizes. We value our patients\' time, but this happens. Really? Then why am I not feeling valued? What part of this experience or apology is supposed to make me feel my time is valued?It\'s really hard to believe my time is respected when they so willingly let other patients run them off schedule so far without consequence, and I\'m left punished for other people\'s irresponsible actions. Especially considering Dr. Mabrie is not new to this, and he should know how long it generally takes him for each patient, new or not. The apology just seemed disingenuous and insincere. If Dr. Mabrie expects his patients to give him the courtesy of advance notice when canceling or being late, he should give his patients the same courtesy. I could\'ve left later and outwaited morning traffic. At 11:30, I had to leave. The lady before me was still in there. I don\'t know when she was finally done. I don\'t know that I will reschedule.I\'m disappointed I couldn\'t get my treatment, but thankfully I have some excellent concealer.'),(3273,281,5,'It has been a week since my visit with Dr. Mabrie and I am extremely happy with the results. As a stylist, I am very critical with details and suitability when it comes to determining the color, cut and style for my clients. Also, as a salon manager, I am also huge on professionalism and service. I was referred to Dr. Mabrie by a friend. I\'m not new to facial aesthetics, and has been through enough disappointing experiences to develop a very meticulous eye for what looks right and what does not. The moment I was in Dr. Mabrie\'s chair, he examined my features and recommended certain services. The consultation was thorough and he instilled full confidence in me and that I was in good hands....Yes, he is pricey, but for quality work... its priceless. I guess I can relate to this because being a stylist, you have to understand the value behind the quality of service and results you are giving to your clients. Clients who complained about prices, usually don\'t appreciate great work... Although I had a budget in mind just for fillers, I wanted great results. I got restlayne and fillers, when I only had fillers on the agenda. But I needed it..... and the result speaks for itself. Dr.Mabrie also recommended voluma for my chin in the future and mentioned that great work can take time.... Sounds familiar!!! I tell this to clients who wants me to take them from dark colored hair to blonde over night or show a photograph of a fine hair celeb when they have coarse curly hair. Its bothersome to read reviews from patients complaining about their results, but they need to understand the face, body, hair etc... can only be or do what it can at a certain and will react different anytime youre alternating it\'s natural state. Only a true professional who values quality and integrity will tell you that. At check out, Dr. Mabrie and I had a misunderstanding about pricing but he and the receptionist worked with me to make sure its not a big deal....I knew the pricings and I knew what dr mabrie was using. It was I who miscalculated.. But regardless, I wouldn\'t feel right haggling about pricing. If that was issue, I wouldn\'t have sought dr mabrie in the first place.

I took my a little over one month just to come across what a thought was the perfect Doctor for me sad to say I was wrong. I emailed his office requesting more information regarding the actual procedure and pricing and they were great with responding promptly. The email gave me a link to his website where I could find more information about lip augmentation. As I came across the pricing I thought to myself is $850 for just one syringe and $180 for consultation really worth it ? Yes, it was at the time! My first impression of his office was not that great. I expected a nicer office since his prices are higher then most places. My consultation went great with Dr. Mabrie that I decided to get the procedure that same day. I normally have really thin lips and wanted to go really big kind of like kylie Jenner so I showed him a picture so we both could be on the same page. I had one syringe injected and it actually did not hurt at all, I was really surprised. When he was all done I knew I would not be satisfied with the size so I requested for a second syringe. He opted to it and wanted me to wait two weeks before injecting another full syringe, so I did. The next day my lips were really swollen witch I kind of liked, I had no bruising what so ever. Slowly the swelling went down over the two week period and to me it seemed my lips were back to the same size : maybe a bit bigger. My next appointment was not all that great. I felt like he cared less this time, And boy did this time hurt really bad. I asked him to make my lower lip slightly bigger then my upper one and he stated he would. It was finally done with. This time I actually thought I was going to love my results but I did not. Over the two week period the swelling went down and so did my lips. My upper lip is way bigger then my bottom lip and I feel they are sooo uneven. I did email his office with my results, concerns and pictures. As of today no one has reached out to contact me what so ever. So if you ask me now, Is it worth paying $1880 for lip augmentation? Definitely NOT!!!!'),(3280,281,5,'Dr. Mabrie is the only person I will trust my face with in the bay area. He is conservative and refined in his approach.

Once I reached my room, Dr. Mabrie was already there on both occasions. He spent a good amount of time listening to my concerns, my nose and chin, and with each issue I raised he would evaluate and provide feedback.

Here goes!I went all out for my 1st treatment... non surgical nose job, cheek filler to reduce undereye circles, nonsurgical chin augmentation, a little a filler added to my upper lip, and a touch of Botox. It sounds like a crazy amount of work, but the end result left my face looking wellrested, a bit younger, and better proportioned. I was worried that these minor touchups would leave me looking drastically altered, but they didn\'t. They really were just minor tweaks. I still looked like me, but a bit better. As for other people\'s responses... My friends didn\'t notice until I told them, and then kept staring at me to figure out exactly what I had done. A coworker asked me if I had met someone, because she said it looked like I\'d had a great makeout session. She told me I was glowing and that my face looked fuller. Oh dear! But the big test came when I went to visit my mom who would be incredibly disappointed if she knew I\'d done this. She didn\'t notice! Well I should admit she kept staring at me, but she couldn\'t place what looked different. I will never tell her. There are just some things she doesn\'t need to know. ;All in all, I had a great experience with Dr. Mabrie. So much so that I\'m going back today for my 6 month touch up. I won\'t be doing everything I had done that first time. It\'s easy to start believing that you need to change all your imperfections, but I\'m thinking that those imperfections make me human and beautiful in their own way. My chin, though.

When I first moved to San Francisco I visited a physician to see if they could do something about the lines underneath my eyes. He suggested filler. He put juvederm in my tear trough area.Result? Disastrous! I had a Huge bruise under my right eye & the product was put in so superficially that you could see squiggly lines of it under the thin tissue of my skin. My eyes were swollen and lumpy. When I went in for my follow up he pushed on my eyes so hard to try to move the product around it resulted in more bruising! Eventually the Dr. had to dissolve all the juvederm & refund my money. This was after 3 weeks of wearing my sunglasses continuously & having people question if I was in an abusive relationship. Sooooo, deciding to find an injector that I could trust with basically the same operation was a daunting task for me. Would the results be as traumatizing? Would I be wasting my money? I decided to have a consultation with Dr. Mabrie and go from there.Insert chorus of angels hereHis staff. Top notch. Professional, courteous, adept at what they do, yet also very personable.Upon meeting Dr. Mabrie I already knew he was going to have an eye for aesthetics. He was impeccably dressed & groomed. Laugh if you will, but I feel this is a solid indicator of an understanding of how things should be in balance and proportioned. A finesse in style may flow over into other aspects of his professional life, such as not over plumping your lips & throwing your facial symmetry out of balance. I explained what I wanted done & then let him talk. I am biased.  I have been looking at my face every day of my life. Having a fresh set of eyes to tell me what I Need versus what I think I Want is a valuable insight to me. I explained my hesitation to have any work done because of the prior incident with the other doctor. He set my mind at ease, showing me many before & after images of his patients who had had the same injectable work done. Never once did I feel coerced into having the procedure. I came into his office fully prepared to pay for the consultation, & if I wasn\'t comfortable moving forward, that I would just leave. Well not only did I stay in that chair I asked for More! LOL. I had restylane injected under my eyes & he built up my cheekbones, my right one especially, with Perlane. I watched every step of the procedure with a hand held mirror & he guided me along, telling me what he was doing and why. I felt no pain at all, even around the delicate under eye area. When he was through I was looking at the same me, only me 10 years ago. I wanted to jump up & down with joy!I don\'t want my fillers to make me look like I\'ve had injections. I want to look rested, younger and vibrant. I got all of those for an incredibly reasonable price & results that lasted 6 months. Trust this man! He is an incredible talent. I know the phrase is over used, but he\'s an artist. He sees the big picture when it comes to your face. This is the image the world sees, but most importantly it\'s how you see yourself.

When I wasn\'t happy with the results, he offered to redo the procedure but said that I would have to pay for the surgical center and anesthesiologist to the tune of an additional $3000. Needless to say, I declined. About a year after the procedure I noticed that my nose would randomly drip. Since I\'d lost some sensation near my upper lip, I wouldn\'t notice sometimes, for a while, and people would have to point out that my nose was dripping. To top it all off, my nose looked worse than before, not only did I still have a bump, it was asymmetrical and you could see into my nostrils. I was finally able to get a revision done last December and I\'m so incredibly happy. My nose no longer drips and my doctor corrected all of the errors with the first rhinoplasty, including hiding a very visible scar that had developed at the base of my nose.

He was gentle, thorough and explained stepbystep what he was doing. Diagnosis? Just another case of eye irritation. Dr. Hirabayashi wrote me a prescription for Lotemax and off I went, not before grabbing a boatload of sample Genteal Dry Eye Drops which he encouraged me to raid.

The staff is nice most of them and I was even able to call in and make same day visits! When I was younger, my parents would always fire a bunch of health questions towards Dr. Wong and he always took out his time to answer every single one! Dr. Wong always attended to everything himself and I remember one visit before I went off to college, how he gave me all this amazing advice for how to succeed in college and even tried to persuade me to go into the field of medicine! It truly shows how invested he is in his patients and is always looking out for their best interest. He is such a great role model and an even better physician. There is no doubt in my mind that when I someday have children, I will take them to see Dr. Wong. Now that I\'m heading off to grad school, I needed some health forms to be filled out and even though I have not seen Dr. Wong in roughly 4 years, he is still that very same physician I knew all my life. I walked into his office I called before to let his staff I would be coming to get some forms filled and he greeted me with a big smile and was more than happy to help me with my forms ON THE SPOT. Even though it was not a busy day, he did not have to fill out the forms immediately, but he did because he is such a wonderful doctor even though there is a sign that says all forms will take approximately 3 days to be completed =]'),(3365,283,5,'Dr Wong is truly amazing! He is kind hearted, very welcoming, and made me feel comfortable and at ease in a doctors office a hard thing to do.

For the first eight months of my daughter\'s life, we lived in San Francisco, and we were very fortunate to find Dr. Wong. He is a caring and extremely knowledgeable pediatrician and a father, and the two go hand in hand. He knows what he is talking about, and he practices what he preaches. Always thorough, he answered any question we had with great detail. Our appointments with Dr. Wong always proved informative and positive, and we thoroughly enjoyed visiting Chinatown to see Dr. Wong, both for the experience of Chinatown and the excellent medical advice we received. The key reason we so highly recommend Dr. Wong is his professionalism, and one instance illustrates this more than any other. One night around 6pm, our daughter had a minor allergic reaction. As she was too young for us to know the cause, and given this was the first time it had happened, we quickly called Dr. Wong. We received the answering service, and he called us back within three minutes. Exceptional. His tone was professional and focused, he asked the symptoms, and told us what to do. Then, he opened an appointment window for us the next day, and we further examined the situation. We were very grateful for his expertise and care in this moment of stress for us. Sadly, we have now moved four hours from San Francisco, and we are in the process of finding a new pediatrician. We can only hope to find someone as great as Dr. Wong! Many thanks, Dr. Wong!'),(3368,283,5,'Love Dr. Wong!! My kids love him too. He\'s so knowledgeable, compassionate, caring, sincere and helpful in so many ways for us.

I\'m telling everyone to go see him! :'),(3369,283,5,'10yrs ago, I had an infected spider bite & almost caught meningitis, but Dr Wong SAVED me!!!

Not only is Dr Wong a great doctor, he\'s a great mentor and really goes above and beyond for his patients!

I went to see him yesterday: I had a really bad day, and he took the time to listen to me even though I showed up 10 minutes before closing same day call! He really made me feel a million times better just by talking and listening to me. When I was leaving another patient showed up and it was already after closing, he did not complain or make them feel bad for being late! Just took care of them, just like he took care of me. I would HIGHLY recommend him to everyone! Thank you Dr Wong!! :'),(3371,283,5,'Dr. Kelly K. Wong, MD is seriously one of the best doctors I know. He is genuinely caring, passionate, funny, honest, and ridiculously awesome. If your child or newborn is in need of a pediatrician who is a respectful communicator, speaks both English and Chinese Cantonese, which is necessary in San Francisco, a doctor who will use his time efficiently to examine and diagnose all possible symptoms of illnesses for his patients, one whom you can establish a longtime relationship with, and most importantly, a health provider who is trustworthy, then you are in luck because you just found reviews on one of the best doctors in the city! ^^Believe me; finding a doctor to examine a child is not hard but finding the right doctor who can do his job above and beyond is difficult. As a child growing up, I was transferred to Dr. Wong when he was practically a new starter. I\'ve been with him for years until I reached the maximum age when my medical insurance stopped covering me. However, I still keep in contact with Dr. Wong, and he continues to offer great advice especially when it comes to serious health issues.As a patient, Dr. Wong always kept me in check to make sure I had my annual physical examinations completed and gave me the immunization shots I needed. He was always a silly doctor who would communicate in a non med speak way so that even people who knew very little about medicine would understand the importance of health and what is causing our bodies to develop certain symptoms that may make us feel ill. Dr. Wong thoroughly explains to his patients exactly what they are there for and what he will be doing at the doctor\'s visit before starting. Rather than just jump right into the normal annualhalf year visit procedures without the doctorpatient bond, Dr. Wong even demonstrates great knowledge about medicine to his patients by explaining basic anatomy and symptoms with visual aids. This of course, includes the body diagram charts, his anatomy book that he used during medical school, and xrays that was sent to him from the diagnostic labs.Choosing Dr. Wong is the right decision for your child. He is a young doctor with over ten years of experience who understands his patients and allow them to make their own choices, communicates well, listens and gives enough time to explain to his patients verbally and visually, and is trustworthy. I am truly lucky to have met and been under the care of such a great doctor! ='),(3372,283,5,'For our family, Dr. Kelly Wong is the best. I have been seeing him ever since I was a kid. I remember not willing to see a doctor although I was extremely sick because I hated doctors. One day my doctor was not in and luck had it and I saw Dr. Wong. Now I am a mother of three and I would not trust anyone else. What I really liked was that he worked as an ER doctor so I feel he can handle almost anything. He is patient and I feel that I can talk to him. He is patient and he always answers my calls no matter what time of night! He is truly a blessing! If I don\'t catch him in the Chinatown office, he has later hours in his Sunset office.'),(3373,283,5,'I understand that everyone has their own opinion and that some people have stronger negativity then others.  But I can tell you from my 13 years of experience with Dr. Kelly Wong that is one of the best pediatric physicians out there. Caring, understanding, thoughtful and detailed orienated. Thanks to Dr. Wong, my three girls are healthy and free of sickness. He\'s is great with my kids, and very detailed in explaining it in plain English for me to understand and informs me of what I need to look out for and avoid. My kids has seen him for 13 years and he\'s never failed me yet. He calls you back no matter what time at night. I remember that he was on the phone with me for an hour helping me through with my daughters 105.7 fever and asthma. Reassuring me and that instructions given were helpful.I recently brought my worries to him about my 13 year old daughter who now needs a full wellness exam, and he said I she can see the Nurse Practitioner for that matter if needed. That is why is has a female physician around to help with these concerns. He\'s very open and easy to communicate with, I say to the people who has negitative review to give him another try, and you\'ll see that it\'s all worth it. Then again, you have your opinions.

They take time to explain things to both the kids when applicable and the parents. My mom is a nurse from MT and came along on a visit with her grandkids. Oh, he is WONDERFUL! she gushes. They are quick, but thorough. My boy and girl 5 and 2 see him for everything, but usually the boy catches the weirdest things. Dr. Wong and Melinda always make time for us and we are so grateful to have them! dd'),(3375,283,1,'I think Kelly Wong is not fit to be a doctor. I was briefly his patient, but I left as fast as you would if you were in the pool with a hungry alligator. He tried to be cool and act as though he is your friend, which might make a patient more comfortable, but as he does that, it would be nice if he actually did his part as a doctor. Not only did he not listen to me, but he brushed off any concerns I brought up. I told him that I coughed mostly at night, but 5 minutes later, he asked when I coughed. A doctor who does not listen cannot do his job efficiently.Years later, I thought he gained more experience and would have improved. I went with my nephew for a checkup, only to be even more disappointed. The wait was unbearably long, not due to another check up, but because he was too busy chit chatting with his assistants. It is okay to have a fun working environment, but isn\'t attending to the patients the number 1 priority? Besides the wait, the checkup itself was not satisfying at all. He sent one of his assistants to do most of the work and spent only a couple minutes reviewing my nephew\'s symptoms. As my sister tries to ask a question, he cuts her off again, just as he did to my mom and me years ago. He simply said he was the doctor and knows what he was doing, and rudely left without further explaining. More importantly, he misdiagnosed and the medication he prescribed did not cure my nephew\'s cold. We had to go to another pediatrician.Needless to say, we didn\'t go back. Kelly Wong may have the credentials, but his bad attitude, lack of concern, and unprofessionalism does not make him a qualified doctor. He does not give the family and patient any support or confidence that he is doing his job properly. I would definitely not recommend him to anyone that I know.'),(3376,283,1,'Dr. Kelly Wong in my opinion is definitely not a good doctor, there are plenty more qualified pediactricians around. I\'ve interacted with him on several occasions where he treated my nephews and each time proved what a phony and fake person he is. He is condescending towards parents, belittles their concerns, and does not show respect. He does not spend time assessing the children\'s condition; most of time, it\'s one of his \'young\' assistants who does the initial checkup. He may do a good job talking, but talking can only go so far....As other another reviewer has said, he is only interested in money. Please bring your kids to someone else.'),(3377,283,5,'Dr. Wong is fantastic with my son and explains everything thoroughly. He doesn\'t recommend medication unless it\'s absolutely necessary and always discusses every option. My son thinks he\'s great. He is very knowledgeable and knows how to talk with kids about not only their medical issues, but also about wearing a helmet while riding a bike or scooter and playing too many video games. I feel very comfortable bringing questions to him and trusting that my son is getting the best care possible. Appointments are usually available last minute.'),(3378,283,5,'Dr. Wong is the best ever!

My mom ran out of patience with other doctors that we have been seeing and finally found Dr. Wong which saw me at the time I was scheduled and if not, earlier. I loved my visits here because he made me feel comfortable about asking him any questions that I had and he would have answered them! But that is not the reason for this review of course...I went on vacations last month and of course with my immune system nothing went well on my trip. I had horrible skin allergies and my body was swelling up. I did not know what to do because I was out of town and doctor offices were not open late well except for this one that I know of so I decided to try calling before spending my vacation in an emergency room!

Here was a knowledgable, compassionate, communicative young doctor who understood our predicament perfectly and worked with us to get the paperwork done. Even though my insurance was not sorted out in time and we had to pay cash and claim back, we had no qualms about making the trek into Chinatown to see Dr. Wong.

Great combination of knowledge of proven current treatments as well as cutting edge health care and technologies.I look for two main traits in my health care providers and Dr. Wong quickly put to any concerns I had when I arrived.

He accomplishes everything while carrying on a friendly conversation.Caring: Even though I had only known Dr. Wong for five minutes I could tell he was the type of person and doctor who genuinely cared about his patients and every experience I have had with him and his staff since has demonstrated that. Flexible scheduling, very available over the phone for emergencies and other issues, available to help with issues relating to you care such as reaching out to your work if necessary.I found his name randomly and went since he was close to where I live. Even though I was a new patient without a recommendation, he saw me within a week and treated me like I had been seeing him for years. He was genuinely interested in getting to know me and not just my ailment and equally enthusiastic in sharing information about himself outside of just being a doctor. It was the combination of all of the extra little things Dr. Wong said and did that left me with a large sense of trust and a feeling that he not only treated but cared.

She tried to wait until Dr. Wong\'s office opened to call but eventually could not wait and ended up calling his answering service to page him at like 6am. He called back in like 5 minutes. He diagnosed her over the phone with gastritis and prescribed her two medications which I promptly picked up from our 24hr Walgreens and gave to my mom as prescribed. She didn\'t feel better so after a few hours we decided to take her to the Emergency Room. Five hours later, after many vials of bloods were drawn, an EKG and a chest xray were done, the ER doctor diagnosed her with acute gastritis. I rolled my eyes at that moment. Really mom? I don\'t doubt that you\'re in pain but really? We went back home. She took another dose of the medication Dr. Wong prescribed but at like 7pm at night she started feeling the pain again. I really didn\'t want to go back to the Emergency Room so feeling like a complete jerk, we paged Dr. Wong again. He told her to take another dose of one of the medications he prescribed earlier and actually took the time to assure her that she\'s not having a heart attack.

She responded quickly to any concerns I had during pregnancy and as needed, fit me in same day to see what was going on. She made every effort to be there herself on the day of delivery. As it happened, I was delivered by Dr. Dimsdale, who was also excellent. He was in the hospital for literally 24 hours and was available for questions and checked in throughout the labor. He helped follow my wishes I wanted to avoid interventions or csection, and at the end of the day, safely delivered the baby. The office sent a dr. to check on me every day I was in the hospital, and the office has a dr. there all day on weekends not just coming in when called. I ended up meeting Dr. Meister, Dr. Fang, and Dr. Lam, all of whom were also patient, helpful and answered any questions.

The reason this review has 3 stars and not fewer are twofold. 1. Dr. Berguig and her nurse Jessie are top notch. Super relaxed, supportive, responsive. Every visit with them is calm and informative. I strongly recommend Dr. Berguig for general care. 2. Based on my experience this practice does have highly competent physicians from a technical point of view.This review on L&D in particular is for mama\'s that are interested in a practice that is universally supportive of natural birth andor expect compassion during the most intense part of pregnancy  labor and delivery. During my pregnancy Dr. Berguig was supportive of a natural birth, but the chances of getting her when you\'re ready to deliver are slim given the logistics of coverage at the hospital. She was also very skilled at talking through the myriad of tests, decisions, risks during pregnancy and never demonstrated a bias one way or the other. She simply provided the relevant information to help my husband and I make the decision that was best for us. Unfortunately around the time of my due date Dr. Berguig was out of the office and I saw Dr. Franca in the office and then Dr. Meister was the attending physician at my son\'s birth. Dr. Franca admitted she was overwhelmed during my 40wk+1 day appt because many of her peers were out. This did not give me confidence in her attention to my progressnext steps. She recommended I go to CPMC for tests the following day because of borderline high blood pressure. This is totally fine and reasonable from my point of view. After the tests the next day I called the GGOBGYN office to ask Dr. Franca some clarifying questions about the recommendation she had passed through the nurse. She told me she was \'too busy to explain\' and I should talk to the Dr. on call at CPMC from the practice. Had she told me the day before to refer to the Dr on call I would have, but she did not. Therefore I was disappointed at her response and lack of compassion. She was after all the Dr. who was telling me to be admitted and induced. I am a first time Mama and all I wanted was a chance to clarify why she was recommending what she was recommending. From there I ended up seeing Dr. Meister in triage at CPMC. Upon entering the room she saw that I was upset. Her first comment was \'Let me guess, you\'re upset because your birth plan isn\'t going as hoped\'. I had never met Dr. Meister and her comment was quite presumptuous. The reality was I was upset because her colleague had cut me off from asking questions during a stressful moment. Dr. Meister was able to answer my questions and it was evident she is technically very competent. My husband and I asked if we could take some time to reflect and make a decision. To which she responded we\'d have to sign a waiver and that a woman who had done the same taken a few hours to get some perspective ended up having a stillbirth. This did NOT help a first time soon to be laboring woman stay calm. I understand needing to sign a waiver if we were to leave, but to reference a stillbirth to a 40wk pregnant woman was unnerving. The lack of compassion was shocking. It felt like a nasty negotiation tactic to get me to do what she was recommending. We ultimately followed her guidance, but it was not without some anxiety. Fast forward to labor and although I had been progressing with out pain meds even under induction her recommendation at 7cm dilated was that I get an epidural to avoid the risk of a csection given where my baby was positioned at that point. This was also practical and good technical advice. Unfortunately however the way it was presented came across as abrupt and unsupportive of any alternative approach. I was tired and it wasn\'t easy, but there was no reason to think I could not get through the birth naturally. Ultimately the CPMC nurse, my birth doula and husband were able to support me to get to the finish line naturally. Her comments and body language throughout the 14 hour period gave the impression she thought natural childbirth was nonsense. There were other things she said that I will refrain from posting, but hopefully this gives enough detail to provide insight to other future mamas deciding on what to do. I did not have a chance to have this debate with her and would love to know what she really thinks. However, in a situation like this she and Dr. Franca\'s actions and words lacked the compassion that I had hoped to encounter. I take 100% responsibility for having selected GGOBGYN as the practice to support me through the pregnancy. Although I wanted a natural birth I also wanted confidence that if something were to go wrong I would be in the care of true experts. I did have some post delivery complications that Dr. Meister handled swiftly, but the lack of compassion during this critical time is enough to send me elsewhere if in fact I\'m lucky enough to have another child.'),(3404,285,5,'I am a huge fan.

To say that I had a rough pregnancy would be an understatement. I was sick every single day, had some pretty scary results from my genetic testing, and I ended up being induced at 36.5 weeks due to increased blood pressure. My entire experience with Dr. Wiggins and ultimately Dr. Callen who delievered my son at CPMC was nothing short of amazing. Both Dr. Wiggins and Dr. Callen are warm and friendly. This is a busy office and sometimes the waits are long, but I believe that it\'s worth the level of care that is delivered. Any time I needed to get in for an unplanned visit, and there were many throughout my pregnancy, they were always very accomodating. Dr. Callen ended up delivering my son, who aside from being a little small, was overall healthy. Dr. Callen was great in the delivery room and I was truly happy with the experienceI felt safe, well cared for, and confident that everything was going to be ok.'),(3406,285,1,'came here saw Dr. Wiggin and she took care of me for my annual exam. It was a good and decent office visit. She is nice, professional and helpful. however, when I try to make my appointment the following year since it\'s a long wait to see Dr. Wiggin I gave another dr. a try. and she turn out to me very inexperience and lack of patience for questions. I admit I am always super nervous when it come to see Dr. but she has no experience to handle nervous patient. Time to find another Gynecologist.'),(3407,285,5,'My first doctor office visit since moving to the Bay Area and was just great. Front desk staff is really welcoming and friendly. Dr. Dimsdale however is AWESOME. He has a fabulous bedside manner and isn\'t one of those doctors that runs tests to just run tests. He actually didn\'t run a specific test because of the number of false positives that it usually gives and was completely upfront about that. He\'s thorough, friendly, wellinformed, completely nonjudgemental and comforting and positive  all of which you want from a doctor. Am really excited to have found such an amazing facility in the city and would highly recommend them and Dr. Dimsdale specifically to anyone looking for an OBGYN.'),(3408,285,1,'WARNING! This practice seems to have it all going on  a nicely appointed office, onsite amenities like a skincare  massage center, they deliver at the wellregarded CPMC, etc.However, several unacceptable incidents have occurred and observations have been made that allow me to fairly say that you should consider other options for prenatal care. Long review, but medical care when you\'re pregnant, especially for the first time, is important!!1 Scheduling  wait time. I agree with other reviewers who have mentioned how disorganized and overbooked this practice is. My very first appointment to verify my pregnancy  GGOBYN attempted to cancel hours before I came in. After a bit of fuss on my part, my husband and I got in and waited over an hour to see a physician. Upon each of my subsequent visits, I\'ve noticed the same trend  you\'ll likely wait at LEAST 3045 minutes before seeing anyone, and if you\'re in the routine checkup stage of the pregnancy, only expect to see your doctor for 5 minutes max. 2 Quality of care. I have only seen Dr. Lam and therefore cannot speak for any of the other doctors. However, I never felt totally comfortable asking the million questions that a firsttime pregnant woman is bound to have. He seemed impatient and dismissive. I was having some skin issues, and after he told me not to use salicylic acid, he sent me over to the onsite skin center for their products....all of which contained salicylic acid. Hmm. Also, you do not see the doctor long enough or at enough of a frequency to form any kind of relationship, at least in the first 2 trimesters of pregnancy. All the more involved testing and ultrasounds are outsourced to SF Perinatal. Just FYI. 3 Incorrect Medical Record Keeping. This did it for me and pushed me to write this review. I made the decision to switch practices best move ever, btw. I now feel totally comfortable, supported and actually cared about. Upon request for transfer of medical records, GGOBYN sent my new practice totally incorrect records. Half of my record had been mixed up with another patient\'s, with totally incorrect surgical and family history. Completely unacceptable. If I hadn\'t checked the documents, it may have affected course of caretreatment at my new provider. At the very least, it\'s been a huge inconvenience and something that I find completely appalling. Just my personal experience here. But I think a lot of other women, especially around the halfway point of their pregnancy, have the same realization as me. My new practice St. Lukes Women\'s Center, receives a significant number of transfers from this practice. I\'ve also anecdotally heard of many women who had a first baby at CPMC and decided to make the switch to a lowerintervention hospital like St. Lukes. Not a coincidence. Save yourself the heartache and start with a different provider!'),(3409,285,2,'The office is very nice, and most of the staff were very pleasant and helpful. I saw Dr. Berguig and she was extremely friendly and had good bedside manner. I had no issue with her as a provider and would probably have continued to see her if the remainder of my experience during this visit wasn\'t so unpleasant. My issue with this practice is that after my appointment, immediately once Dr. Berguig sent me on my way to the lab, the level of care changed drastically. I was sent off to a lab for routine blood and urine samples. There was only one person available who was able to draw blood and she had a long line of people waiting. Initially, the nurse told me it would be 20 minutes and that there were two people ahead of me. I figured they were probably a little busy and 20 minutes really wasn\'t that bad. The nurse then kept pulling people in front of me to help them first. Two people turned into either four or five, I lost count. I ended up waiting about an hour to have my blood drawn before I walked out. I may have considered staying if the woman who was taking care of patients in the lab seemed at all concerned or apologetic for the wait and confusion. Instead, she just kept pulling in patients from different doctors ahead of me. If it is at all helpful to anyone reading this, this is my second child. I\'ve been seen by two other practices one private and one hospital for my first pregnancy and I hadn\'t ever experienced service like this. I definitely understand that sometimes offices get busy and sometimes you have to deal with an unexpected wait. This seemed just plain disorganized.'),(3410,285,5,'Absolutely wonderful physicians!  Wiggins delivered our new little Ollie yesterday and Dr Fang delivered our oldest son 2 yrs ago. They were attentive, caring supportive, experienced, and most importantly, extremely competent. Dr Callen is my wife\'s actual OB and she was great too.  Thank you GG staff. We are a happy and healthy family!'),(3411,285,1,'Worst obstetrics and gynecologists ever! First of all, they have no obstetricians only gynecologists. I had a high risk condition with my pregnancy and Dr. Fung Lam gave us a painful HSG test and never gave us the complete results. The test was taken in December 2013. It\'s been a few months and they never gave us the complete results of the HSG test till date! I took 4 tests here through Labcorp which is in the same building as their office in December 2013 the results of which have not been given to me till date but they happily billed me $500 after insurance for those tests. For my HSG test I had to threaten to sue them in order for them to provide me with my results and they gave me less than half the results of my HSG test. People working here greet you with a smile but that\'s where it starts and ends they never get back to you. You can never get anyone on the phone and VMs are never returned. Their doctors pretend to be busy and don\'t give you appointments but are not actually busy. I had to visit the ER and visit my gynecologist the next day as per the ER hospital instructions to get some urgent tests done. I call this office and they say they have no appointments for the day as well as the next 2 months. My friend who had been seeing an obgyn in this exact office gave them a call that same day as I did, to see the exact same doctor and they gave her a same day appointment within 2 hours of her call and even told her that their calendar looks pretty good for appointments all afternoon whereas the same time they told me that they are not just booked for the entire day but the next 2 months. Our phone calls to them were 10 minutes apart and in fact, I called them before my friend did so how in the world they get booked for entire 2 months is surprising to me! Wow! Very discriminating and unprofessional!Couple of months pregnant I found a great OBGYN in San Mateo area and she was surprised and angry as to how can someone who call themselves obgyn be so unprofessional and cant even do their basic job! She was furious as to why they won\'t provide us with the complete results of the HSG tests. Wonder what golden gate obgyn is getting paid for? I reported these people to the concerned authorities. Any action has been taken or not we don\'t know but we certainly hope that karma gets back to them and they shut down one day. My new OBGYN spends an hour or more of her time with me and my husband on every visit, answers every question and doubts we have with patience, available via texts and phone calls in case of emergencies, available to provide same day appointments for emergencies, always checks up on me like a family member would and keeps a tab on everything related to my pregnancy and health. That\'s what a good ogbyn is like if you think what this particular scam of an obgyn provides in the name of service and care is actually that!Dr. Fung Lam and Dr. Wiggins  do not go to them! Ashley  I hope she is fired  is the worst employee in this office. She is supposed to get back with test results and never till date provided me with my first four labcorp test results as well as the rest of the HSG test results. I would not recommend any doctor in this office. Try to find an OBGYN in the peninsula or north bay if need be, trust me, its worth the drive and you are in safe hands but do not put your pregnancy and your baby\'s life in the hands of these thieves. If you have a uterus condition or high risk pregnancy do not trust the uneducated and unethical doctors at golden gate obgyn but go find a proper Obstetrician or a proper Gynecologist who will actually think of your health and well being and work with you. Even if you have a normal pregnancy might as well find a good, ethical gynecologist for your needs than these scammers.'),(3412,285,5,'I loved this place. Beautiful office space, although location can be challenging during traffic hours. Dr.Leslie Meister was fantastic throughout my prenatal, delivery and postpartum care. She was up beat and did lots of teaching, which I appreciated as another physicianthere are just some things we don\'t learn about in medical school or when you\'re in another specialty. Unfortunately, I\'ve moved away and have found care elsewhere but not nearly as easy to schedule as this place was.'),(3413,285,5,'So far, I LOVE THIS PLACE. The receptionists are very sweet, the offices are beautiful and modern and clean... no nasty doctor lighting.I had a really rough beginning to my pregnancy with sickness and depression, so my husband called to make an appointment and explained the urgency of the situation. It was around Xmas right after so it was already a busy time... but they said they would try to fit me in and they did... they were able to get me in... which is quite a feat to get into an OB so quick.Dr. Jason Dimsdale seems amazing and I am so excited I was randomly assigned with him. He seems very knowledgeable but willing to answer questions and always takes time to explain things to me. He helped calm my nerves and make me feel better about my sickness and depression. He took control and told me what needed to be done, etc. which was really a relief since this is my first pregnancy and I have no idea what I am doing : I was a little worried to be seeing a male, as I wasn\'t sure I was as comfortable as I would be with a women, but he is very reassuring and easy to speak with.They also have a system of you peeing at home and bringing it in to your appointment, instead of having to do it at the doctors appointment. I think this is a nice option. They check certain levels at each visit.They are located right next to the lab too, so you don\'t have to go to another place in the city to get blood drawn and tests done. This is a really nice feature. I went right over with the papers after my appointment and had the blood drawn, etc. for the tests needed and they said they would send results to the doctor.I am looking forward to my next visit at this office, as it is a very nice place.Another bonus for this place is that they have a skin and massage place on site. They also sell vitamins, etc. They do prenatal massages and other treatments.This place helped to ease my concerns and everyone seemed to go out of their way to be very nice.So happy my husband found this place for us. I recommend coming here!'),(3414,285,5,'I\'ve been going to Dr. Karen Callen at this practice for 5 years and am a huge fan. It\'s very professional and welcoming. I\'m told that all of the doctors at this practice are excellent. We are having our first baby at CPMC, which is the hospital that the doctors use for deliveries. You are not guaranteed your doctor because they rotate being on call, but with all of the doctors receiving such positive recommendations, we are not worried.The other great thing about this facility is that they just started offering different types of classes to take during pregnancy. We just finished Childbirth Preparation with Tori Kropp, RN. The class was excellent! We are also planning to take Babycare Basics with Tori. They also have spa and massage services available, although I haven\'t tried them. I highly recommend the practice, Dr. Callen, and the baby classes!!'),(3415,285,5,'I have nothing but good things to say about this place.

Everyone from the receptionist to the one dr. that I saw they do a rotation so that you get to know all the doctors was wonderful.

I would highly recommend this office to anyone who is looking for a good group of obgyn\'s.'),(3419,285,5,'What a great practice! They never cease to impress. I specifically am a huge fan of Dr. Lesley Meister. She is the best. She is very friendly, and knows her stuff. She never seems rushed, and answers all of my questions. She has a way of never seeming stressed. I don\'t know how she does it. She has a daughter of her own, which I always appreciated. She didn\'t actually get to deliver my baby because Dr. Lam was on call. I was hesitant at first because I had met with Dr. Lam once, and he wasn\'t my favorite. I got a weird vibe from him. However, he was amazing at the delivery! He was super calm and helped me feel comfortable. He did a great job, and did a little photoshoot for us after my daughter was born. He used our camera, and took a bunch of family photos for us. Such a special memory.They validate parking, but only for the first fifteen minutes, so it\'s very expensive to use the parking structure they recommend. Just take the bus, or go early and do street parking.One thing I disliked was that you have to take a cup home to do a urine sample. At other OB\'s, I know they just have you do the urine sample in the office. The receptionists are great, and they have glasses of water for you in the waiting area, which is nice.'),(3420,285,5,'This office is such a cheery place. While waiting in the lobby I almost forgot what I was waiting for... oh yeah that. The wait to see one any of the doctors who practice at Golden Gate was 3 months.

I received a phone call the Friday before my Monday morning appointment reminding me of what I needed to bring, where the office was and what time to arrive. Very helpful. I saw the PA at my exact appointment time. She was very diligent and made absolutely sure I didn\'t leave with any unanswered questions. Great practice. I don\'t even think a shot of the best tequila could have made this visit more enjoyable.'),(3421,285,5,'StaffReceptionists are very nice friendly here and all the doctors we met were great.

I have a 2 year old son and another one coming in April. Dr. Fang is still my obgyn and my favorite doctor of all time.

This practice is tooooo busy and has far too many patients to give quality care. The doctor delivering our baby literally left me in the stirrups while I was pushing to attend to another birth. She delivered 11 babies that day, granted there were 2 sets of twins, but that\'s just crazy. Dr. Galaif is great, but as a practice I would not recommend them.'),(3425,285,1,'I had a bad experience with Dr. Lam. When I went to see him, I told him my concerns and he said that the would run some tests for me and call me in a few days with the results. I didn\'t hear back from him after a week, so I called and left a message you can never talk to anyone live explaining that I was approaching the end of my plan year and was anxious to complete any followup appointments and fill any prescriptions in the next three weeks so they would be under this year\'s plan  I had already fulfilled my out of pocket and my insurance was paying for 100% of everything! I received a call back from the doctor, but he seemed puzzled as to why I had asked him to call me. When I explained that I hadn\'t heard back from my test results at least a week overdue he began giving my test results back to me. One of my hormone levels, he said, was almost zero and also my cholesterol was high. After reading the results, silence. So, I asked What are the next steps? Dr. Lam was completely confused by this question. When I pointed out that he had just told me that two of my results were abnormal, he sputtered around I finally had to help him out by discussing the proposal for the low hormone levels that we had discussed in his office. I gave up on the cholesterol and decided to modify my diet for a year to see if it helped. I may not be a doctor on tv, but I play one in real life!I\'m not really sure why this guy was such a dud with me. I know some people push the patient empowerment thing too far, but I swear I\'m not one of those people! On the other hand, I\'m not one of those people who blindly do whatever their doctor asks without even asking why. If my hormone levels are low and he doesn\'t think I need treatment, a two minute explanation would probably suffice. is that too much to ask??Beyond Dr. Lam\'s weirdness, also annoying is that this office lacks communication and operational efficiency. The last time I was there, there were 8 women in line waiting to sign in with the receptionist and the line wasn\'t moving fast. I had to wait in line for 10 minutes just to hand them a form that they forgot to give me when I checked in.. Maybe they should have spent less on the fancy office and hired a few extra people instead. The other issue is that I have never got a live person on the phone and voicemails are not returned in the specified time or ever. I have a certain prescription that I cannot get refilled via my mailorder pharmacy because this office can\'t manage to call them back and give them the information they need. I have to go to a local pharmacy and pay a higher coinsurance. Thanks.Maybe this is a good place to go if you are pregnant. I think I was the only nonpregnant woman or woman without an infant there.'),(3426,285,4,'These ladies are fantastic!Like some other reviewers, I\'ve always used free services and had never experienced a place this fancy before. However, it\'s not the fancy that makes it a great place it\'s the doctors and RNs. They make an unpleasant experience totally bearable. They are warm, understanding, and efficient. I also really like that I can see and deal with exclusively women. I\'ve seen Ramona and Dr. Wiggins, and both of them are great. I\'ve never had a long wait, and have always been able to get an appointment. Oh, also, you can make appointments online AND they are open on SAturdays. Other info: they accept most insurance, and the reason for knocking off one star you have to sign a mandatory arbitration agreement, which I\'m morally opposed to as a law student.'),(3427,285,5,'This review is for Dr. Leslie Meister. She is fabulous and I couldn\'t say enough complimentary things about her. I have recommended her to my personal friends that are considering Obgyns and now\'s my chance to recommend her to even more people.She is friendly, knowledgeable, and made me feel incredibly comfortable through my entire pregnancy and through delivery. I originally started coming to her before I was even pregnant and loved her then too.Any question or concern I ever had she knew the answer right away.Also, I see a couple of comments on Yelp about the front desk being rude and I honestly have to say I never had a bad experience with anyone at Golden Gate, and towards the end of pregnancy you are going in about once a week!

The waiting room is so cute and warm, and has tons of awesome magazines. A sweet pregnant woman took me back to the exam room, and then I got to lay down and listen to french jazz while I waited. It was so relaxing that I ended up napping for a few minutes I am studying for the bar exam right now, so this napdespite being on an exam tablewas pretty amazing and necessary. So now that I\'ve sufficiently raved about the office itself, let\'s move on to my main reason for writing this review. I\'ve been seeing Carolyn Muir for a couple years now she also works a few days a week at UC Hastings, and she has always been really attentive, kind, and helpful. I feel really comfortable around her, which is saying a lot considering how uncomfortable these types of appointments can be. She kinda feels like that cool not inappropriate aunt who you could talk to about sex. In sum, I really hope that I can continue to see her after my insurance changes at the end of the year!'),(3430,285,5,'This is more of a review for Dr. Dimsdale than it is for the office in general, since almost all my contact has been with him or his assistants. I used him for my OB care while pregnant from JanAug 2010 and loved him. His PAPs are pain free, he makes you feel really comfortable and cared for during your visits.I\'m not your average patient either. I decline most prenatal testing, and want an intervention free pregnancy and birth. While Dr. Dimsdale had made comments like he would want an epidural if HE was giving birth, he never made me feel bad for my choices, he always listened to my concerns, discussed them with me and allowed me to be in charge of my care the entire pregnancy. I was very concerned with the reputation of CPMC of being very high intervention, but he put me right at ease that I could get the care I wanted with him. I later had a homebirth, but I returned to Dr. D for my postpartum checkup and scheduled my Essure procedure in October 2010. He did the surgery for me, met me at the hospital and briefly talked to my husband before walking back with me and making sure I got to talk to all the surgical staff and that I was 100% informed and at ease with the procedure. It was quick and easy, completely painfree. He showed me pictures of the insides of my fallopian tubes, proving the Essure implants were placed correctly, and that\'s the last time I\'ve seen him. Between his office moving across town and a change of insurance, I decided not to continue my GYN care there. One thing that never quite made sense to me about the whole operation however, were the pee bottles. They\'d give you a little glass sample size jelly jar, and tell you to take it home. Next appointment, pee in it that morning and bring it with you. I used to worry that I\'d get hit by a car on my way to the visit and the paramedics would wonder why I have a jelly jar of cold urine in my purse! After asking hundreds of women online, not a single one has ever been asked to bring urine from home to every prenatal exam. So that was an adventure!And as far as getting through on the phone, I quickly learned it was near impossible. I would make all my appointments in person, and also walk over to speak to them in person if I had any questions or needed to cancel or change something I only lived a few blocks away from their California St office and would always do business with them that way, to save my sanity and cell phone minutes.'),(3431,285,5,'I have been a patient of Dr. Callan for over 20 years.

Sometimes, a little TMI. Just hang in there, this review has a point...Despite my TMI nature, I do have my boundaries. Call me a prude believe me, I\'ve been called worse anything involving work down there is what I consider very private and a little awkward to talk about. Obviously, I consider a gynecologist visit one of the most NECESSARY evils for feminine health maintenance. As a child of an Asian mother, who has maybe gone in for 2 pap smears in her entire reproductive history and is the same woman who basically just handed me a pad and said congratulations when I got my first period, I used to consider choosing a gynecologist a perfunctory task. It took my first BAD gynecologist experience in my 20s to wake me up and realize that I really needed to pay more attention to MD selection. I really never had an amazing gynecologist and if you ask me, I don\'t even remember any of their names prior to moving to San Francisco in 2003. When I moved to SF, I asked a girlfriend to recommend one to me. The gynecologist recommended seemed to be friendly and very efficient, but some of the bedside manner seemed to be lost. She was more interested, at the time, of promoting a new technology for hair removal laser...awkward. Well, she left the practice and I was followed by someone else for several years. Yet, what I absolutely abhored about that practice is that I was, literally, just another warm body waiting to be seen. The practice seemed not to have any personality unless you were PREGNANT. My complaints about that gynecologist practice will be in a separate review.Yet, for this review, I want to tell potential patients about how DIFFERENT and POSITIVE of an experience that I had with GG OBGYN and Dr. Jason Dimsdale. It was a BREATH of FRESH AIR. I\'m so pleased that I\'m overcoming my natural shyness about these type of feminine things and reviewing the experience.1st  The ease of scheduling. As a new patient, I went online and registered on their online website. Everything, including scheduling of visits and getting medical records can be done online *yay*2nd  Because I was a new patient, the scheduler sent me a nice email that my first new patient appt had to be scheduled via telephone. 3rd  I was able to secure an appt with Dr. Dimsdale who I found through a recommendation via another doctor within 3 weeks YAY4th  I was running late to my visit, but they were able to reschedule me on the same day please note that they have a BIG SIGN at the registration desk that states that if you are 30 minutes late that they may have to reschedule you. If you are less than 10 mins, I believe, they will try to fit you into the schedule.5th  Pleasant receptionist6th  Quick check in and minimal wait time but keep in mind that this is both OB and GYN, so if someone\'s giving birth or if there is an emergency, you may have to wait or be rescheduled...7th  Dr. Dimsdale MADE ME LAUGH during what I consider a very uncomfortable process...my annual checkup.8th  Dr. Dimsdale did not make me feel like a creature with 3 heads bc I\'m over 35, single and without children. He reminded me that PLANNING and considering if you want children in the future is important. he mentioned egg banking...for instanceLove it, love it, love it...Of course, I can\'t say that I\'m really looking FORWARD to my next visit. Yet, I\'m not dreading it so much now either. YAY.'),(3437,285,3,'This is a good practice with experienced, competent doctors. I had Dr Lam and he was considerate and helpful. Sometimes I found him a little paternalisticold school but there was no doubt in my mind that he was genuinely devoted to his patients.Why 3 stars? Unfortunately, they didn\'t inform me of their nodoula policy until too late  I was 3 weeks away from delivering  and I had to scramble to find a different practice. So as a warning to those considering Golden Gate  if you\'re looking for the emotional support of a doula, it would be best to go elsewhere. My conversation with Dr. Lam revealed that they see doulas as providing minimal pros candlesdim lighting are just aesthetics, doulas shouldn\'t be massaging you since they aren\'t trained masseuses, what support could they provide that wouldn\'t be given by a drnurse, etc and significant cons interfering with the medical process, not having medical training, imposing natural birth ideology on the process. Based on my own research and talks with doctors, this is not the case with the vast majority of doulas, but you always have to be careful who you hire. And since emotional support was important to me, it was worth transferring. However, the hassle in doing it was not pleasant!So if you\'re fine with that policy, go for it  they are great doctors. Otherwise, I would recommend looking elsewhere.'),(3438,285,4,'I love going to see Dr. Fang! she makes an awkward test, tolerable :P.'),(3439,285,5,'Dr. Meister can look at my vagina anytime.I\'ve had the pleasure of seeing her for several visits now, and for such an uncomfortable yet necessary exam, she has the most wonderful bedside mannersweet and bubbly, but not annoying so.

The support staff are constantly juggling phones and tending to patients, yet they still manage to exude friendliness and carry an air of professionalism under pressure.

Thank God Dr. Yee was on call that night and continued to be my surgeon for what was to be the most painful and complicated recovery process. I was in the hospital for 19 days and am still recovering. I can\'t emphasize enough what a great doctor this man is. He is compassionate, genuinely interested in the welfare and health of his patients and made me feel like everything was going to be OK during a very scary time. He has a natural humor and ease and I can\'t recommend him highly enough.

Soon, I had two maybe three gallbladder attacks and decided that I could procrastinate no longer. Dr. Yee was awesome and so was the staff at the Presidio Surgery Center. Recovery was smooth. I followed up with his office with a few questions and they were are very attentive and responsive. I\'m a bit embarrassed to call it a real surgery  I really did feel better in no time at all. Very appreciative it\'s over and grateful to Dr. Yee and his staff!'),(3442,286,5,'Dr. Yee is extremely personable, and is genuinely interested in dealing with your concerns. He went over in detail, even drawing pictures, to explain what the procedure would involve. Hard to evaluate a surgeon\'s skills when you\'re under general anesthesia, but enough to say it went well, I healed quickly, and the margins were clear. I would recommend him to anyone who needs this type of surgery.As a note, the reviewer that was put off by having to sign an arbitration agreement, almost all doctors now require that. With medical malpractice insurance skyrocketing using arbitration, is one way to help control healthcare costs.'),(3443,286,1,'Dr. Yee, wow, my experience was not the same as others.  My primary Dr. saw that I had a couple hemorrhoids and said that a surgeon could just snip them out or band them.  He recommended me to Dr. Yee. I went in and he told me that he could not band them, one was too large. I had not had much pain from them, but they had gotten a bit worse over time.  I asked during the first meeting how long the surgery would take to recover from. Dr. Yee seemed hesitant to give me an answer.  So, I said, 1 week?.  He did not give me a solid response, so I said 1  2 weeks. Now he seemed to say that, yes, that is about right. Never did he tell me that this is one of the most painful surgeries one can have.  Not a single warning or word of caution. Only when I began the slow and painful recovery which takes a typical patient 3  4 weeks to recover from.  Anyone curious should do a search on the internet and find forums about such a surgery. I went to the emergency.  I went back in to see him a couple days later, thinking something must have gone wrong, it was then that he first told me, his words! well of course it hurts a lot, this is by far the most painful surgery I perform. So, if he really cared, he would have told me this prior to the surgery, ya think?Later in the trauma following the surgery, I even went to an Emergency Room once with such pain that it seemed unbearable. In a call to the emergency line, the physician I spoke with told me that when he does this surgery he tells each patient to take a month off of work, that he makes it clear that this is the norm for recover and he kind of was my perception rolling his eyes over the phone in disgust or disbelief when I told him that I had been told 1  2 weeks.  I was able to work limited after about 3.5 weeks. Pain was there for more than 2 months.  Picture needing over 100 pain pills and I do mean needing and you can perhaps imagine this.  I have had 4 shoulder surgeries, a broken femur, shattered ankle and none of the pain from any of the recoveries from surgeries compare to the pain from this one!Also, when I came to in the recovery room, he came by with pictures of the hemorrhoids piles he had removed.  I told him I don\'t want to see them.  He grinned in a weird way and acted like I should want to see the work he was so proud of.A side point here is that if you are considering this procedure, please, please, do your homework ahead.  If you are younger, take fiber supplements and eat a lot of fiber food, this will help you avoid such a nasty predicament.2 months after surgery, I went back and got another surgeon in the office to look, diagnose why the wounds were not healing.  He went back in and reset the wounds so that they would heal right. More unbelievable pain. I am now 9 months out and have issues related to this procedure still. I was way better off prior to this whole thing.  The only positive that came was that I communicated with Dr. Yee about how much of an injustice it was to not brief me about the pain involved in the recover and in the end he apologized for this and promised to be way more up front in the future Thank for this Dr. Yee.'),(3444,286,5,'If you ever need to go under the knife, this is your man.

I visited him initially at his office where he took the time to explain all of the details of my surgery. Not once did I feel rushed; Dr. Yee let me ask as many questions as I needed to get clarity. During my hospital stay, Dr. Yee visited me each day, and had a remarkable bedside manner. Watching him with the staff, you can tell he is just a really nice guy. If I could give Dr. Yee more than 5 stars I would. My recovery has been very smooth, and the laparoscopic incisions are fading to where they will barely be visible.

They need more chairsor a bigger waiting room . . . one time they ran out of places to sit for all their elderly patients. Better yet, stop overbooking and allow for a less crowded waiting room environment. It is tiring to wait and have listen to other\'s strange conversations about issues I rather now hear. 1* One Star: They overbook their appointments constantly! The first time there were 4 people booked at the same time I was and the room was full. I waited 1.5 hours for my 10 minute appointment. 1* One Star: The Second time I went they overbooked again. I had 34 people who were booked at the same time I was. Then, Dr. Yee was running 30 minutes late. I was told this after waiting 20 minutes. I decided to leave and rebook for another time.The Third time, he was in surgery and was running 45 minutes behind.

He\'s super friendly and I can tell he has a genuine interest in the care of each of his patients.

I liked that he wanted additional diagnostic tests before confirming surgery was needed. And he even suggested that my OBGYN be present for the procedure she was involved with my situation from the start, which made me feel more at ease. I have to minus one star due to the usual front desk issues  it\'s no better here. One week before my procedure I was told that I needed a lot of tests and a physical done  a heavy load to schedule in such short notice, especially on top of the stress and anxiety about the procedure in the first place! And this was only because I had called them for another reason  I would have never known these things needed to be done if I hadn\'t asked! The staff had scheduled my procedure several weeks before and could have told me then. However do not let this deter you, Dr Yee is super nice, has great bedside manner, and is quick and thorough.

I really wanted to run out the front door. I went on autopilot at 7:20 am and I filled out the necessary forms. Everybody from the receptionist to all of the nurses and assistants were so fantastic, but I know I was still freaking out \'inside\'! Then I saw Dr. Yee. That great smile and his reassurance that all would be fine was all it took for me to settle down.

It appears that most of the 12 ratings are in 2008. Also, what I found was that the type of behavior that everyone states that they experienced from him had the same pattern in 2008. SO, I can only deduce that something really bad either in his personal life or in his business dealing. But, again I am guessing. NO matter what was going on in his personbusiness, this does not excuse the alleged  behavior that the reviewers are comment on and does not excuse the alleged verbal abuse not offering alleged full payment disclosure in any situation.  I have been a patient on and off for 6 years. I have a skin type that requires a doctor who has a certain expertise in this area. I have not had a problem so far and my adult acne has gone away after I started using the Retinal drops, Glycolic Gel, Salicylic Face wash that he sells.  It worked for me within two week;  I have tried a lot of other brands that just burned my face, dried it out and really did not do the trick so, it was great that his stuff worked so fast. After going to another doctor, lets call him Dr. A, who did not spend any type examining my scalp problem nor did the Dr. A physically examine my ongoing scalp problem, nor did the Dr. A do a complete skin examination as I requested: , I went back to Dr. Zanelli and he was able to diagnose my scalp properly it was a problem for over 2 years and give me the meds to clear it up plus suggested over the counter products that were very effective. Also, Dr. Zanelli gave me free minisamples to take care of a lot of my issues. Also, they have free minisoap and other cleaners sample in the large bowl located on the coffee table in their lobby. I have never seen that in any doctor\'s office. That was new to me. I love the classical music, the Italian paintings etc. It feels very relaxing to wait in the lobby. Most doctors don\'t take the time to decorate their waiting lobby in a manner than reflects their personal taste and passions outside their profession. I like that.

He goes on to say, My attorney has been apprised of your actions, and if your posting is not removed or changed to reflect an honest representation of what happened we will pursue any and all available legal remedies against you.Wow! That\'s a mean mouthful. I\'ve heard that Dr. Zanelli sends letters of dismissal to patients he\'s had disagreements with, but legal action?! Give me a break! It comes as no surprise Dr. Zanelli is confused by the meaning of the word integrity when he made the statement: You lack the integrity to fully explain the details of your visit. He made it clear these details of my visit refer to the undisclosed part of my review. These details are private and irrelevant to my review, and in choosing not to disclose this personal information has nothing to do with lacking integrity, as Dr. Zanelli suggests. He is simply grasping at straws.I would recommend that he scroll down to the bottom of this page and click on the section entitled Business Owner\'s Guide and give it a thorough reading.... particularly the part that says: DON\'T lash out at the people who have written negative reviews about you. He may also want to pay close attention to the section: Responding to Negative Reviews, and he will find that the manner in which he reacted is a prime example of What NOT to do. And while he\'s at it, he might consider writing himself a prescription for Chill Pills. The following is my original, unchanged post and it constitutes nothing but my honest opinion.__________________________________________________Okay, I\'ve never had a totally unpleasant experience with a doctor before and I\'ve seen my fair share but Dr. Zanelli changed that.My experience with him was anything but good. I went to see him for a procedure which will remain undisclosed. He agreed to do the procedure, but only if I received botox first to relax the muscles. I didn\'t really want botox, but since it was offered as a prerequisite to the procedure I wanted, I reluctantly agreed. Then, after spending hundreds of dollars on Botox, he changed his mind and refused to do the procedure I had initially come in to see him for, and for which he agreed to perform. Not only did he refuse to give me a refund, but worse, and more telling, he was condescending in his refusal to understand how I could possibly feel cheated. I left his office feeling taken advantage of and belittled. I go to doctors to feel better, not worse.Instead of seeing Dr. Zanelli, I strongly recommend Kurtis Opp, who is in the same building. He\'s not a doctor, but is a physician\'s assistant with many years experience. He really knows his stuff and has the best bedside manner of any health care professional I\'ve ever encountered. He\'s honest, trust worthy, and won\'t try to push expensive treatments and products on you that you don\'t need.'),(3488,287,1,'I found Dr. Zanelli to be a complete jerk, entirely uninterested in the problems I asked him to address, and focused on creating problems that he could hand out samples, scrips, and charges for. Yes, he has a nice office. But I have more than a strong suspicion that he\'s a frustrated artist who turned to dermatology to pay the bills. Look at the degrees on his walls; obviously music didn\'t work out for him, so he had to get a real job.My suspicions were confirmed when, a few months after visiting him, his office denied refills on some of the common medicines he\'d prescribed. They said I needed to come see him again. Come on. I had mild acne, possibly rosacea. Like I need to see him again for that? He\'d done nothing invasive or exploratory on me; he basically spent five minutes looking at my dry legs and reddish face.Not to mention, he was a condescending bitch throughout the visit.'),(3489,287,5,'Dr Zanelli is a great doctor, its always been a joy to be treated by him'),(3490,287,1,'Terrible experience.

He always treats me himself, and really knows my history; 3 Caring  Dr. Z. follows up with me and is always on top of my health.

This helps me to really trust that he has my best interests at heart; 4 Artistry  Dr. Z is the consummate artist.

He then told me, without checking or asking about what my policy covered, that my health insurance wouldn\'t cover it so I would have to pay the total amount of $350. I value my health, and so I went along with his professional opinion. So, the surgery takes about 1015min, and presto we\'re done. As he\'s cleaning up he takes a look at my face and sees one pimple which he asks if he can pop. I say sure, whatever makes you happy doc! He pulls out a little metal prod and pops the sucker. Fast forward, I get a bill in the mail with the following charges, New Patient E&M 200.00, Acne Surgery yeah SURGERY! 210.00, Pathology Level 125.00. This does not include the 350.00 I forked over on the day of the visit. The total charges for a 20min visit were $885.00. Pathology Level is standard, New Patient E&M, standard, however Acne Surgery is excessive, and it turns out my insurance would have partially covered the bump on my head.

I brought in my laptop to show him photos as reference of what I liked and Did Not like which he appreciated and found very helpful.I went with saline, round, high profile implants and went behind the muscle  280CC for the larger breast and 300CC for the smaller one. It was at Dr. Mossers suggestion I get high profile which only came in round at that time due to my small framediameter and to set the implants behind the muscle for a natural finish which is exactly what I wanted. I went from literally being a negative A to a 32C bra size and to this day still get complimented on how real they look. People have said to me: Ok, either you have the most perfect breasts or I want the name of your doctor because we can\'t tell if they\'re real or fake! : Granted, certain bra\'s or tops I CHOOSE to wear can make them look fake but for the most part they look real which was the ultimate goal and I\'m still so happy with the outcome. Anyway, the staff was so friendly and welcoming too and made everythign so easy from start to finish. After my consultation with Dr. Mosser I was also able to meet with an advisor to help get the surgery financed which was all approvedcompleted that day  even scheduling my surgery. It came out to $7,500.00 which includes my initial $900.00 deposit and I only paid $238.00 a month for 2.5 years. The price was higher then the norm only because I got high profile implants which at the time was still rather new but in the end it was all so easy and affordable for me at 22. The day of my surgery I was naturally nervous but he totally put me at ease and made me feel comfortable and I knew I was in good hands. My postops were fast and easy too.

A lifetime of back and neck pain has plagued me but the idea of surgery for someone who has only gotten a wisdom tooth pulled was pretty scary.Dr. Mosser\'s office gives you all the information you could possibly need which really does help with the anxiety. I walked out of my preop appointment with a folder full of information on what i should start doing to prep for my surgery and what to expect the day of and the following couple of days after the surgery. I also received a pack of vitamins with instructions on what to start taking before surgery and after. I can say my healing has felt pretty fast tracked and I honestly believe the schedule of vitamins have been why. Arnica, Bromelain, plus morning and evening multivitaminsI originally met with a different surgeon last year and while i felt she would probably do a great job something about our meeting felt very cold and clinical. Some people really like that. I found out that I didn\'t since this surgery felt very personal to me and I needed to have a comfort level with my surgeon.

Forget that I had already paid for my mom\'s plane and hotel to come in and take care of me a few days away. Forget that I had cleared my work calendar and now clearly don\'t have time to schedule a surgery with someone else. This is not what patient care looks like. Furthermore, his staff fell down on the job TWICE and didn\'t even try to get funding preapproved through my insurance even though they said they would.

Dr. Mosser was a little more expensive that the other two doctors\' bids, but I wasn\'t looking for cheep, I was looking for a lifetime of good results, and I got them. I had watched about 20 hours of gynecomastia surgery videos on youtube and did lots of internet research before my 3 consultations, so I was prepared. Self educating is important. The other 2 doctors seemed like this type of surgery was a secondary thing to them. The impression I got from Dr. Mosser was that he was rightonit, like it was his primary thing. I didn\'t want to have my back done originally because of the increased cost. He talked me into it and didn\'t charge me extra I think. I\'m glad he did.  I love my body now!

Going thru high school with tits was not fun, I would have done it 30 years ago if not for the cost. But the expense was easier for me in my late 40s.

I swear whenever I call whoever picks up the phone is always so friendly on the other end. When I come in for whatever reason, each lady greets you with a genuine smile and calls you by your name. Now, you may think, Duh, of course they do! That\'s what they get paid for. But, there is reason there is a 1 star rating, because some people do the bare minimum of their duties with an attitude. Since the beginning of my time interacting with these ladies, I have ALWAYS felt like I was talking to an understanding girlfriend. Which is great because then you can ask those questions you may either view as stupid or embarrassing without feeling selfconscious. If there is a question they can\'t answer, they will speak with doctor, and get back to you ASAP.Now, onto the greatness that is Dr. Scott Mosser! I have coined him the Fred Astaire of breast augmentation. If you know anything about good ole Fred, he studied, practiced, and honed his craft relentlessly until it came across as effortless. What I am saying is He does what he does, and he does it well. He also is patient in answering any & all questions without making you feel rushed or annoying...Believe me, I know. No matter what I have gone in there for I take a minimum of 510mins describing what I want. He sits patiently and takes in every word I say without seeming frustrated, but glad to know how he can give me what I want. As far as my breast augmentation goes, I am lil more than a month out and they are EXACTLY what I asked for and I couldn\'t be happier. I came in countless times to try on sizers and ask questions, before I FINALLY decided what I wanted. Each time I came in I either had a netbook full of pics for him to look at or a collage of boobs I wanted. He never showed any sign of frustration, but was the exact opposite...ready & willing to listen and discuss my ideas as far as what I wanted my end results to be.I got my BA the week of Thanksgiving and had to call him 2 times for different reasons. Although the office was closed. I spoke with the answering service to leave a message and he would call back within 15 mins. He politely listened to whatever my concern or question was without sounding annoyed that I was disrupting his Thanksgiving holiday. Each followup appointment I have is with him, whereas I know someone who had a different Dr. state they always met with the nurse. For myself it makes all the difference that Dr. Mosser is who I meet with for post op appts for such a major surgery.

I have confidence in the massive amount of education they have under their belt. Dr Mosser is a great surgeon. He is a great doctor. He is a genuinely good person. I did my research as everyone who has elective surgery should do. Not only should you make sure they are members of specific boards  check if those memberships are current. I checked everything I could on him online. When I visited the office, my mind was made up. The staff were not only warm and friendly, they were knowledgeable about my many, many questions and concerns. When I met Dr Mosser, it was like meeting an old friend. He approached my body with respect and didn\'t sell me an impractical end result. He was committed to making me the best version of who I am. That means a lot to me because I genuinely like myself which means I genuinely love my body. It is nice to work with someone who understands me.I had three procedures at once. My end result was exactly what I was hoping for! I have minimal scars with taut skin! I am also wearing a dressbra size that is accurate instead of accomodating a crazy amount of hanging skin. The reasons Dr Mosser and his staff garner a perfect score from me:  Dr Mosser is committed to his craft  you can tell by his degrees, the many organizations he is a member of, and the hospitals that welcome him.  Dr Mosser is very easy to talk to. You don\'t feel overwhelmed with his replies to your many questions and concerns.  Dr Mosser is such a good person. You know he is doing what he does because he loves it. He is interested in understanding what your goals are and how he can facilitate them utilizing his impressive surgical skill and eye for aesthetics.  Dr Mosser does charity work. That to me is HUGE. I respect that because it illustrates a seriousness to ones craft and a humility in giving back to the world at large by sharing one\'s skillsgifts.  Amy and Melissa are great with explaining fees and discounts. That financial stuff can be really tricky for people who are emotional about money. They handle the finances really well and I am not emotional about money. Amy and Melissa were excellent in coordinating my surgical schedule, providing information neatly organized in elegant binders, and answering any questions.  Tracy is is friendly and efficient. That will prove beneficial as you schedule postop appointments. Her genuine warm greeting when you come into the office really makes you feel good to be there. The prestigious 450 Sutter address Dr Mosser\'s office is in offers great parking for $6hr and a little mom and pop Deli get the fresh fruits! If that wasn\'t enough, Dr Mosser, Amy, Melissa, and Tracy had flowers delivered to my home. That is a reflection of the sincerity in the care and concern they offer to their patients.

He was honest that one issue I had could not guarantee it could be fixed, he recommended I ignore another issue because it was minor and not worth the pain of surgery, and referred me to another specialist for a third issue I had.'),(3514,288,1,'I came here about 7 years ago for a rhinoplasty. The Dr. Was nice and I was pretty confident with my decision after reading all the reviews. It took me many years to save for this procedure there were cheaper Dr.s but I decided to go with him and pay more because this is my face and I didn\'t want to take any chances. I was in my early 20s and I have been wanting it done since middle school. Kids made fun of me all the time because it was too big. Unfortunately I\'m not happy with the results. I feel like it is still big and bulbous on the tip. When I take pictures of myself all I notice is my nose. I went to him to eliminate that problem but I\'m still feeling insecure about it. I also have some nerve damage on the right side of my nose that tingles and irritates me every time I touch it or someone touches it. It took me a long time to write this review because I am not one to complain but when I see other nose feel I jealous and I feel sad because I spent so much money and I am not happy at all with the results. Think twice before u try to change something on your body because the results might not be what u want.'),(3515,288,5,'I was extremely disappointed in the Nurse at Dr. Mosser office.  She tried to sell me some products that are to be used for people having laser treatments. However, as an African American, I cannot have laser treatments on my body. It wasn\'t until I went to my doctor at Kaiser, that I discovered she had tried to sell me something that I didn\'t even need! That\'s not good! Boy was I happy that my Carecredit was over the limit, and I couldn\'t purchase the products. What a lucky break for me, and not a good recommendation for them. I spoke with the office and discovered that I was given the right products, it\'s just that different doctors recommend different products, or have different procedures.  I really enjoy my Nurse and now that everyting this is cleared up, I will be going back.'),(3516,288,5,'This man is an artist. No lie! I went in after losing a lot of weight and not sure what kind of outcome I would receive. I was hopeful, but wasn\'t unrealistic with my expectations. I have to start out by saying that I never usually feel comfortable with male doctors. All of my doctors are female. I read all the reviews and did my research and decided that I would definitely get a feel for him after the first consultation. I figured if I felt uncomfortable at all, I would just stick with a woman doctor. Let me just say that I felt comfortable immediately with him. He has a gentle nature and is very knowledgeable about what can and can\'t be done with your body. He doesn\'t give you false hope that he can do something that he can\'t, and doesn\'t try to sell you something you don\'t need. That said, after the first meeting, I decided to go ahead with the tummy tuck. This is the first of 3 surgeries I will be getting done. Next will be my thigh lift already scheduled, then arm lift and breast lift. So, lets talk about the tummy tuck, since I\'m now a little over 10 weeks post op. Yes, this is a tough recovery, because come on, it\'s your stomach and there aren\'t too many movements you make without using a stomach muscle. That said, even after the first few days I looked in the mirror and wanted to cry. It was just beautiful. Seriously, I\'m not a dramatic person, and I literally teared up. It just got better and better. Even the photos I took one week post op were like looking at a different person. The scar is low, so it is easily covered by underwear.....low rise underwear. This scar is seriously low. My belly button looks beautiful. I never really thought much of I before, but let me tell you, I notice it now. I\'m super curvy. Now with this flat belly, I turn heads. I did this for me, not for anyone else. I wanted to look good for me. I wanted to look in the mirror and be proud of what I saw. I do. It just feels nice for other people to notice it as well. I have a confidence that I didn\'t have before. All of this, thanks to my wonderful doctor. So, let me get back to him, and his office staff. They are amazing! Everyone is so friendly. They are always so cheerful and they remember you by name. You start with meeting Odette at the front desk who is always so cheerful and incredibly sweet. Then Amy who was a huge help in scheduling the consultation and is very knowledgeable about the procedures. Then Alisha who helped schedule the surgery, who is also very knowledgeable and helpul. I have sent her so many emails with questions and she is always willing to help. That said, you can email pretty much anyone in the office and if they can\'t answer a question for you, they will ask the doctor and get back to you in a very timely manner. I have to say, I have never had a bad visit. Everyone is so friendly, and the office has such a nice atmosphere. I gladly recommend Dr. Mosser to anyone I know looking for an amazing plastic surgeon. I\'m excited to see how my next surgery come out in 2 12 weeks. I feel completely confident that it will turn out as amazing as the first one.'),(3517,288,5,'This office deserves nothing less then five stars. The office is clean and airy spa like.

I had been contemplating this surgery for YEARS and had tried many times with my healthcare provider Kaiser. I\'ve been overweight and quite frankly big boned all my life. I\'m 42 now and losing weight gets harder and harder with time. But im also very happy with my size i fluctuate between 245 high and about 215 comfortable low. Kaiser will do the procedure for free but they want you to jump through all kinds of silly hoops, especially the weight loss hoop. They want you at a standard BMI which just aint happening for me . An ideal weight for me would be 210.....Not Dr Mosser. He can work with you whatever shape or size and still produce great results. I did my homework. I was welcomed by his staff during my initial visit and he was also warm and friendly. He will answer every single question you have how ever many times you ask which is very reassuring. I paid him 3 visits and the last visit I had my mom and husband in tow to convince them that he was my choice. He is super great before during and after surgery, and quite frankly he\'s confident he can do the job because he can. My goal with my surgery was to still have voluminous boobs but not the extreme uncomfortable size that I had for so many years. He proportioned me something fabulous and I am one happy camper. You will be too! I\'m still healing but I feel so so so so great.

I wish I could remember the girl at the front desks name, because not only did she make me feel immediately at ease including my blueberry candy she offered me something to drink while I waited.I was whisked away just a few minutes later into the procedure room where I met Jeanne.

I\'m not sure how long the procedure took, but I was made to feel at ease the entire time, right to the minute I left, when I was offered a seat if I would like before I left.I admit, the negative reviews had me a bit nervous, but as soon as I woke up the next morning & looked in the mirror, I knew I had to write a review & say Screw the negative reviews!

When I arrived, they did not have my appointment on the schedule, and told me the Dr. was in surgery, asking if I could come back in 30 minutes. I agreed and was called just 15 minutes later being asked to come back to meet the Dr., this seemed like a bit much to ask of me, but I returned anyway. When I arrived Amy took me in a treatment room Dr. had not arrived yet  and asked me what type of plastic surgery I was interested in. I reminded her of our conversation, that I had no interest in plastic surgery, just fillers. Then I was left to wait in the room until Amy came back to tell me the Dr. was further detained and would meet with me as soon as possible.The Dr. being detained was not a big deal  he was in surgery and attending to his patients which was commendable. The lack of order and abundance of confusion by the front desk staff and his nurse Amy made me very nervouse however and I ended up leaving the office before meeting the Dr. My thinking was if he has people that are not on top of things running his office, it could translate into the work he does  it is my face after all and I was not comfortable finding out the hard way.'),(3523,288,5,'I can\'t say enough about how satisfied I am on the procedures that were performed by Dr. Mosser. First, the staff there are the best. I received consultations at several other offices and always felt like they were selling me used cars. Dr. Mosser and Sondra made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process, answered all my questions and I never felt pressured. I\'m male, mid 30s and I\'ve always wanted a flat chest. I decided to have Gynecomastia surgery aka male breast reduction and I also threw in the liposuction procedure since I was already going to go under and the cost wasn\'t that much more.To be honest, my expectations were pretty low since I didn\'t want to get my hopes too high and I wanted to be realistic as to the end results. Cut to two and half months after my surgery and I now have a flat chest as in flat, flat! I really can\'t say enough about how happy I am and how the results blew away my expectations. I\'m now wearing the tshirts I\'ve always wanted to wear and I can take off my shirt poolside without feeling self conscious. It\'s really changed my life. As to my midsection, I can\'t say enough about how great everything turned out. It\'s like the cherry on top of the sundae. No, I don\'t have a six pack but I do have a countered mid section and can wear pants without the muffin top.I can\'t say that the surgery was pain free. On a scale of 110 10 being most painful, I would say that at the worse, I was about at a 7. This was mainly days after the surgery and it was mitigated by pain killers. After the first week, the pain felt similar to the soreness you feel after doing weights and situps for the first time. A little after two months later, I have no pain, a little numbness, and the scars are slowly going away. All in all, for me, the cost and pain were well worth the results. I\'ll also say that Dr. Mosser and his staff were there for me after the surgery. I\'ve read horror stories about the doctor and staff not being available post surgery. Dr. Mosser sees you two days after surgery plus you begin a schedule of appointments that start off with once a week office visits and then slowly taper off as you start healing.This surgery has really changed my life and I\'m so thankful to Dr. Mosser and staff for making this overall experience so pleasant. If you are unhappy with your body but you have realistic expectations and you can afford it, I would 100% recommend Dr. Mosser.'),(3524,288,1,'21k seems a lot to pay for a facial filler.

At the consultation, he claimed that he had done many of these, then when it went badly wrong he said that the product was just coming onto the market and that results were unpredictable. It is hard to know which is true. In any case, Dr. Mosser became very stern, had no recommendations for me, and I was dumped as a patient. He also denied to take the discount on his special offer even though the offer clearly listed this procedure and had no expiration date.  You will see that Dr. Mosser\'s prices are very high compared to others.

But here\'s my story...Once I made my decision to have breast augmentation, I started looking for a surgeon in all the right ways. I used direct referrals from people that had implants and were happy with their results. NONE were for me. So I started looking online...the wrong way to find a surgeon. I found Dr. Mosser\'s incredible reviews and did my homework confirming his certifications, verifying no complaints had been filed, and had an acquaintance plastic surgeon verify his credibility and reputation. Everything looked good, so I scheduled my consult and immediately knew that Dr. Mosser was the surgeon for ME. Unlike my other consults that either sugarcoated surgery, made me feel pressured, or just lacked that necessary bedside manner, Dr. Mosser was downtoearth and approached surgery as the important, medical decision it truly is. 6 months later, I cannot express how happy I am with my decision. You\'ll spend a lot of time at the office for preop and especially postop care. Throughout all of these appointments, the staff exceeded my expectations. Every question was answered and every phone call was returned.

He is an inexperienced doctor who makes false promises just so he can get paid. Both Dr. Mosser and his office staff are completely inept at even the simplest tasks. Once he tries his best at the procedure, good luck trying to get a hold of him with any follow up issues. At my initial meeting with Dr. Mosser, he laid out a plan on how to proceed with my breast augmentation. I told him my concerns and reasons why I wanted the augmentation mainly due to rippling of the skin from my previous breast enhancement. Dr. Mosser said he could fix the issues and I proceeded to have the surgery. About 6 months after the surgery, I noticed most of the initial issues were still present and a few new ones existed. I tried multiple times to get a hold of Dr. Mosser to discuss these unsatisfactory results and he was always either away on vacation or out of the office. There were several instances when we had a call scheduled and he would keep pushing it out three or four times. When I finally did reach him, his only explanation for the new scars and ripples was that nothing is going to be perfect. When I demanded that he fix the issues that he created, he simply dismissed me and said he cannot do anything to fix it. I understand some procedures are not perfect. This is not my first time having this type of procedure. So I went to get several opinions from other doctors. I have been to five other doctors and they have all said that the scars and rippling should not have occurred from this procedure, and that it is possible to fix. I\'ve given these new doctors my surgical report so they know exactly what was done. When I went back to Dr. Mosser to inform him of the different methods of fixing my issues that these other doctors suggested, he didn\'t know anything about it! He left the office to google the procedures and consult the internet about these standard procedures. The solutions the other doctors presented were to inject fat to reduce the rippling or to use a thicker stratice so the scars would not be visible. Dr. Mosser simply said that he does not know how to do these other procedures and that he will not fix the issues he created. Dr. Mosser is completely incompetent and should not be trusted!! He did an amateur job, botched the results, and refuses to spend more time tending to his patient.

Last year I was running for the cable car, tripped, fell, broke my wrist, and landed on my face. Not my most shining moment. I had two black eyes, a fractured nose, broken tooth and cut mouth from the fall. I looked like I had been in a car accident.After the initial trauma wore off, I realized something was stuck on the inside of my lower lip. Well, guess where my broken piece of tooth was? Not on the sidewalk where I hit. The pieces needed to come out because they were sharp. Something like this was obviously a piece of cake for Dr. Mosser to fix, but the important thing for me was that I felt just as important with my little reconstructive surgery as I would have if I had opted for multiple elective procedures. I never felt like I wasn\'t worth his time which frankly is what I expected walking into a cosmetic surgeon\'s office. Not only is Dr. Mosser a great surgeon, he is very personable and listens. I feel sorry for any doctor that I see, because I am the biggest scaredy cat on the planet and I start to get nervous as soon as they knock on the exam room door. He took all of this in stride and handled it beautifully.As icing on the cake, Dr. Mosser also makes trips overseas and fixes the cleft lips on underprivileged kids.

My dermatologist Dr. Elias Michael who is amazing by the way recommended I see Dr. Mosser saying that he was a well respected physician here in the city. I don\'t know if any of you have ever had a biopsy done before but it\'s literally where you have a moleskin cut off and in some cases have to do a few stitches, and they test what\'s been cut off for cancerous cells. In most cases they heal really well, but other times they don\'t, this is why I wanted to go to a plastic surgeon for the mole that was on my face especially since it had been tested positive for basal cell cancer, which meant that a larger part of it would need to be taken off. When I had my first consultation with Dr. Mosser he was extremely professional, he told me all of the options that were involved in this situation, and he explained to me what would need to be done for the procedure in detail. Needless to say I felt extremely comfortable with him and we did the removal a few weeks later, the incision looked flawless, the line was so straight I couldn\'t even believe that someone could do something like that to the skin, and it was at least an inch in long. The test results after the removal came back positive in terms of having removed all of the cancerous cells, and I went in for several check ups after the removal, even up to six months afterwards because he wanted to make sure it healed well. So I\'m writing this a year later and sharing my testimony to Dr. Mosser fine precision and work, you can\'t even tell that I had any work done it\'s amazing!!

I was a 36A cup aspiring a 36D which required a big implant. They needed to look naturally youthful, and feel soft and real. Also, the nipples were somewhat distant to each other, so he needed to make them stay in the right position. The results were amazing:I achieved the desired size 36D, requiring 550 ccs in each side. they are very natural looking, yet blissfully big.The incisions were small, carefully placed and perfectly closed. they are not noticeable, in fact, they are very well hidden.They feel AWESOME!

Otherwise, I would have had to fly to Canada or wait until 2007.I chose Juvederm because of its relative ease of injectability when compared to some of the more thick and painful fillers that were already widely in use. Dr. Mosser did an excellent job of injecting just the right amount of Juvederm into each of my nasolabial folds, leaving me looking smooth and natural with very little bruising. [Slight bruising can be common in some people, but not necessarily everyone. Dr. Mosser did NOT recommend this, but I used the homeopathic gel arnica after the treatment and my eversoslight bruising at the injection sites went away within a day or two.]What is important here is that my face appeared younger, slightly fuller, and my nasolabial folds were nearly symmetrical...like they were 10 years and 10 pounds earlier. It was a beautiful effect, and it lasted for me a year. For $600 the cost of one vial, this was money well spent. I will return to Dr. Mosser again, should I ever lose too much weight and my face become too unhealthily gaunt.'),(3542,288,5,'When my twin sister and I decided to have a breast augumentation, it was really difficult to find a surgeon that was experienced, professional, and trustworthy.

Dr. Mosser did a wonderful job and made our appearance look very natural and beautiful.     The staff and Dr. Mosser are so nice and really care about their patients and wants whats best for them.

Thank you so much, Dr. Andrews!'),(3545,289,1,'The reputation polishers are busy shining up the Andrews Yelp page. It\'s too pitiful.Susan B. and Bob I., both posting 5 star reviews on the same day, for Brian Andrews MD, are most likely professional reputation polishers. Yelp, you should be ashamed. This is not a taco stand we are rating;  this is a MD who cuts into people. Dr. Andrews is dangerous because people go to him in pain and distress. They trust him. Then, he injures them and gets angry when they express dismay that their condition is worse after seeing him.He makes unimaginably tragic, lifechanging mistakes. I\'m offended in particular by Susan\' and her glib comment:  I suspect any negative reviews are from patients that expect a Doctor to hold their hand and say Oh poor baby  you will not get this from Brian Andrews.There is insufficient space here to list what you will not get from Dr. Andrews, but proficient care is definitely one thing that you will not get with Dr. Andrews.I\'d love to have Dr. Andrews do to both of you what he did to my father, specifically: lie about having completed a spinal decompression when in fact, Andrews by his own admission failed to perform the full decompression. Dr. Andrews actually started to cry when trying to apologize to my father who, after a year + of worsening pain, weakness, and symptoms, went to get his file and go to Stanford. When one fails to finish the surgery one starts, it is tantamount to aggravated assault. FYI: A person is guilty of aggravated assault if he or she attempts to cause serious bodily injury to another or causes such injury purposely, knowingly, or recklessly.So to all you reputation polishers: let Dr. Andrew work on you. Believe me, you\'d get really good at being in constant pain and weakness, and you\'d get really used to using a walker.Poor babies indeed.'),(3546,289,4,'I personally like a doc who can deliver zero back pain with a minimal amount of office time & chitchat. Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m the worlds\' biggest extrovert and could talk to anyone all day, but by the time I got to Dr Andrews, I was done talking about my horrible back and wanted to take action....I wanted OUT of the pain. I was painfree when I woke up save for some incision site soreness. Only reason for 4 out of 5 is that I could see how some people could possibly be put off by the lack of warmth in bedside manner but I needed an outstanding surgeon not another buddy....and it worked for me.PS I am from the East Coast and tend to find the short, cuttothepoint style of communication very efficienteffective & it does not offend me in the slightest but I can see how it is not everyone\'s cup of tea.'),(3547,289,5,'Dr. Brian Andrews was very kind and personable. He carefully listened to me when I described my problem and performed an examination after reviewing the records that I brought with me. He matter of factly suggested a procedure that was much less invasive than what I had been offered by other \'super specialists\' around the state. I believe in finding and traveling to the best surgeons for their expertise. All of them wanted to do a spinal fusion through the front of my neck which could have been career ending for me. Then a well known microsurgeon at UCLA wanted to only treat one level of my cervical vertebrae at a time, and to return for separate surgeries. He put me through costly painful tests that were found to be inconclusive. Dr Andrews was able to relieve my chronically pinched nerves by opening the foramen on C5 & C6 through one small incision behind my neck. I woke up from Outpatient Surgery with the feeling restored to my fingers and thumb. I went home afterwards with only a band aid and have been improving ever since.For those patients who have criticized Dr Andrews, perhaps they should take a look inwards. Not everyone is a \'good patient\' and not everyone is a good candidate for treatment. Many chronic pain sufferers have a long winded irrelevant \'story\' they insist on telling, and they won\'t listen to the doctor\'s questions, or give relative answers. Some people will never be satisfied, much less happy about any improvement in their condition. They want to tell their life story, they want to be coddled and they want guarantees. They then become angry when they are told that the doctor doesn\'t care for the doctorpatient relationship....it goes both ways.That Dr Andrews may dismiss a patient, or refuse to do surgery is a reflection of his professional good judgement. I hope Dr Andrews enjoys his successes and continues to provide the brilliant, no nonsense, miracle care to those of us who appreciate his expertise!'),(3548,289,5,'My recent experience with Dr. Andrews is one of the best, and most unusual experiences I\'ve ever had with a medical professional. Let me explain:I\'ve had problems with pain radiating from my neck to my right shoulder on & off since a bike accident in 2009. Shortly before beginning a 1month vacation at Lake Tahoe, I woke up in agony and even went to the ER where they proclaimed the problem to be related to a pinched nerve and sent me home. I then had 2 epidural shots into my spine and the pain was gone, so we resumed our vacation as planned.3 days into the vacation, the pain returned with a vengeance. I went to the local ER where they admitted me and administered valium and diliuded to reduce my pain. I contacted Dr. Andrews office but was told he had no openings until January. Another doctor contacted Dr. Andrews on my behalf and very shortly I was sent his cell phone number. I called that, left a message and received a return call in about 5 minutes. I explained that I was in excruciating pain in my right shoulder but that I believed that it was originating in my spine. Dr. Andrews asked that I return to San Francisco as quickly as possible and bring my MRI with me. He said to come straight to his office, so the local hospital doped me up so I could tolerate the trip and my wife drove me back the next day.I want straight to Dr. Andrews office and his receptionist showed me right into an examining room. Dr. Andrews spent a few minutes reviewing the MRI and then came in. He described the problem I was having between 2 pair of vertebrae and said that I should go immediately across the street and check into the hospital and that they were alerted that I was coming. He said that he would go in earlier the next day and I would be his first surgery patient.I went to the hospital where they admitted me with no problems and then gave me drugs to minimize my pain. The next morning I had the surgery. I spent a total of 4 nights in the hospital and was released with a regimen of drugs to minimize pain. My pain is much less than prior to the surgery and I have no doubt that I\'ll make a full recovery.A number of people have downgraded their review of Dr. Andrews because he doesn\'t spend a lot of time chitchatting with them. These people should realize that if he did, there would be someone like me in another room, in absolute agony, who needs his skill and needs it right away. His job is to find out enough about your condition to make a proper diagnosis. Then, if it\'s something that can be corrected by a surgical procedure, to perform that procedure and see to it that you receive the proper care in the hospital. Anything more that that and he\'s taking time away from some other patient who needs his skill.Thank you, Dr. Andrews, for your skill and concern and for seeing me and treating me so quickly. Because of you, I\'m now back up at Lake Tahoe enjoying watching my grandkids play in the lake.'),(3549,289,5,'I have been suffering from severe back and leg pain. I could barely get out of bed in the morning and I had tried and given up on chiropractors, physical therapy, therapeutic massage, etc. I\'ve heard great things about Dr. Andrews\' neurological skills from friends that have gone to him in the past and been helped immensely. They told me that he is worldrenowned with patients coming from all over to San Francisco to be treated by him. Fortunately I was able to get in to see him and he was enormously helpful to me too. My MRI had been reviewed by several experts and it was not until Dr. Andrews discussed my symptoms in detail and reviewed the MRI very carefully that he discovered a synovial cyst which was pressing directly on a spinal nerve, causing all the pain. Being a neurosurgeon he could easily have recommended surgery, but I appreciated it when he recommended an immediate epidural steroid treatment as a first, noninvasive step. I\'m pleased to report that the pain is virtually gone and I have resumed normal activities. The epidural was performed by Dr. Savala who is a very skilled anesthesiologist. He took the time to really talk to me, review the MRI and he even contacted Dr. Andrews to ask a couple of additional questions that came up in our presurgical discussion. Even though they squeezed me in to their busy schedules they never seemed rushed or inconvenienced, indeed they all were most informative and accommodating. Both are very busy, indemand doctors, but they took all the time to answer my questions and describe the problem and alternative solutions.I hope my spinal problem is solved. But I also know that steroids can be a temporary fix and ifwhen I need another procedure I will definitely go back to Dr. Andrews and Dr. Savala.'),(3550,289,5,'My experience with many surgeons is that they are often arrogant and difficult to talk to about one\'s condition. Dr. Andrews was anything but that. He was forthcoming with a wealth of information and knowledge from many years as a good surgeon in San Francisco. He was very unalarmist, yet up front about what he felt the best procedure would be to deal with my compressed disc problem. I would and will high recommend him to anyone seeking a good surgeon in San Francisco for back problems. It was a pleasure to meet him.'),(3551,289,5,'I think some of these reviews are complete garbage. I understand wanting a doctor that you bond with socially, that seems to listen and care, blah, blah, blah. But you don\'t go to this doctor for your average condition. He\'s busy. He\'s got a long list of people who want to see him. And I don\'t blame him for rushing some patients so he can get on to the next one. The point is he\'s that good, and if you need him it\'s worth it. As a note, I don\'t even remember their being any communication issues or feeling like he didn\'t care. It wasn\'t important to me because I just needed someone to perform the function to save my life. I was lucky enough to be referred to him for a spinal condition that had left me partially paralyzed and literally peeing in my pants. I had a short 10minute session with him during which he explain the surgical procedure that could help me and answered all my questions. About a week later, after waiting for years, I was in surgery and he fixed the issue. The relief I felt was immediate and has been continued for the past 2 years.

He did a great job on my back and all my symptoms are now gone. I was up and around in a few weeks based on the way he did the surgery. Being the son of a doctor and a nurse and a brother to another doctor, I\'ve seen many many physicians, and I can assure you he is in a world of his own when it comes to the practice of medicine. He is a true professional and unbelievably intelligent.

Although I was taken to another hospital\'s emergency ward, I requested a transfer to CPMC when several friends of mine in the medical profession pointed me toward Dr. Andrews, describing him as one of the very best neurosurgeons in the Bay Area.I did consult with other neurosurgeons before seeing Dr. Andrews and they recommended surgeries anticipated to be between 5 and 10 12 hours. Dr. Andrews scheduled his OR for 3 hours and completed the spinal fusion in just 2 hours. A surgical nurse friend of mine who has assisted Dr. Andrews in several of his surgeries explained that Dr. Andrews is very demanding of the OR\'s staff and the OR preparation so that he can perform his surgeries with laser point focus. The time that I spent in recovery and therapy was 13 the period of time that injuries such as mine require. I am sure that the primary reason for this shortened time was that the time that I was in surgery was only 2 hours.People in the medical profession will often say that surgeons are a different breed. Few within this breed have excellent bedside manner, many are abrupt and exhibit limited peopleskills. If you want a doctor to comfort you and respect your opinions, your research or your feelings, you should avoid most surgeons. If you want a surgeon who will be minimally invasive with laser like focus you may have to accept abrupt stilted bedside manner.On the other hand, I enjoyed Dr. Andrews\' bedside manner, and I marveled at his concise manner in my follow up appointments.

My symptoms were mild when I saw him in November of 2012, and his recommendation was to do light swimming and light stretching, which I did. As the pain progressed and spread throughout my nervous system, he did not want to deal with me any longer. It was as if I had had done something wrong. His only suggestion to me was to take Cymbalta, which had horrible side effects, and I could not tolerate it. He said he could do nothing for me based on my my MRI\'s of my L4L5. I felt neglected and hurt. How could a doctor whom so many on this yelp list praise be so unresponsive to my medical needs? I was not seeking surgery from him, only answers.

He never once looked me in the eye, never let me finish a sentence, and didn\'t have much to say in general. He did not do an exam and didn\'t get a complete history on me because every time I tried to answer a question he interrupted me.

Absolutely top in his field....the BEST of the BEST. Does not push unneeded surgery. Dr. Andrews is the person to see for any serious neurological traumas.  I was first referred to him in 1990 by my chiropractor & primary doctor post auto accident whiplashcervical injury. Increasing numbness and tingling in left arm  he had me get an MRI and confirmed C56 herniation. He encouraged me to try PT before surgery, which I did but PT failed to help. He arranged a 2nd opinion for me  and I had C56 laminectomy. He visited me every day 4 I was in hospital. Full recovery took about six months with PT and have never has been perfect since.  1992 I was rear ended again and he checked laminectomy by MRI  all OK  but administered a corticosteroid epidural injection to ease numbness and tingling and that solved the problem.  My husband has been a patient of Dr. Andrews & was encouraged to wait 3 months before opting for surgery due to a bone chip causing pain. Andrews said most herniationschips settle down after that time wout surgery. Sure enough after  3 mos my husband was back to golfing, fishing and bowling and Dr. Andrews was pleased to say he could not improve on that with surgery.  Dr Andrews is brilliant and in high demand. He must make the best use of his limited time by getting to the point quickly during office visits and several times in 1990 my followup visits were rescheduled due to his having been called away to emergency surgeries. I do not mind this small inconvenience.  Most recently when I was in ER on Christmas Eve, 122412,with excruciating leg pains, he took a call from my ER Doctor regarding my lumbar herniation and instructed me to call his office on Thursday after Xmas and tell his staff that HE wanted to see me that same day. You can\'t ask for more dedication than that.  I had a thumbsized herniation and he recommended a corticosteroid epidural or microsurgery. I opted for the epidural but if I do need microsurgery no one but DR. Andrews will do the procedure.

I had seen a few chiropractors with not much success and had done some physical therapy which gave only temporary help.The initial call was cold and the reception stated the first available appointment was 10 weeks away and that I would need to book and then keep calling back to see if there had been any cancellations to get me in earlier. There weren\'t and I called every week until my scheduled appointment.Upon my first visit, I needed to fill out paperwork and then was asked for my copay prior to seeing the doctor. I thought that was rude but figured it might save me time later so I paid.The doctor was 15 minutes late but was cordial and asked me to describe my pain areas. He didn\'t give me any physical examination but stated that he would need a CT Scan to see what was causing the chronic pain. I was told to make an appointment to return to see Dr. Andrews in two weeks so that would give him time to receiving and review the scan. I was fairly lucky and was able to go directly to Xray in the main area of the hospital and was scanned within 45 minutes.I arrived 5 minutes early for my second visit with the doctor in case I was required to fill out any new paperwork and was told the doctor is running late. I waited for 45 minutes before being lead back to his office. He entered 10 minutes , stated he was sorry for the wait and said to come over to his computer to look at the scan results. He then attempted to find my file and could not and left the room. He returned and stated that they had not received the scan but it was being sent over and should be in the office within 10 to 15 minutes. I was instructed to wait in the office and then 20 minutes later, the doctor returned, entered a disc into his computer and spent about 5 seconds dialing through the images and stated I have slight arthritis and there is nothing more he can do. He suggested ibuprofen and to stay away from Chiropractic help. The fact that he only looked at the scan for seconds and was supposed to have reviewed it indepth prior to my return plus the 5 other people in his waiting room didn\'t make me feel like I was getting first rate medical care. In addition, I have received three bills for the second visit copay which has been paid.I spent 75 minutes for a 5 second review and the only thing on this doctor\'s mind is my copay!

Lots of exercise  made it hurt more.2. Chiropractic, including traction  made it hurt more.3. Acupuncture  what was I thinking? I was desperate. It made no difference.4. Avoiding any kind of up and down motion. No jogging, no dancing.

I said I assumed it would get worse as I got older so I thought surgery might be the best option and he agreed. I certainly didn\'t feel he was trying to sway me either way.He had me do another MRI because it had been so long since the first one and saw me for another consultation less than a week later. He showed me how things were deteriorating by comparing the two MRIs and then scheduled me for surgery about a week after that. I am amazed at how quickly I was able to get the surgery done.Surgery was outpatient at the Presidio Surgery Center; it was just a tiny incision I submitted a photo that you can check out with full anesthesia, to get to the nerve root so Dr. Andrews could clean out the gunk compressing my nerve. I arrived at 9:30am, was checked in and treated very well by all the staff. They gave me IV vancomycin to avert any issues with opportunistic infection and my partner was allowed to sit with me while that went in. Then I was wheeled into surgery and they put me out in about 15 seconds. I think I was under by about 11:15. When I woke up I was wondering when they were going to start. That\'s a testament to how little discomfort I was in I believe they put in a local anesthetic when they close up. I was out of there by about 2pm. My partner had to drive me home of course as I was certainly too woozy to manage transportation on my own.I took maybe two of the Propoxyphene I was prescribed on the day of the surgery and then switched to no more than a couple of Ibuprofen a day. Despite minimal pain medication, I have had no more pain than when my neck was in spasm and every day it\'s been feeling better. It\'s been 5 days now and I\'m not taking any drugs at all, all I need is a neck rest every now and then, but I can now work. I have a followup with Dr. Andrews in 3 days and I\'ll finish this review then.FOLLOW UP:It\'s been just over two weeks now. I went to see Dr. Andrews for a followup. I\'d say he was certainly cordial enough, but gave the impression of being in a hurry more than wanting to really explain the surgery. This is his famous bedside manner, I suppose and possibly a realistically good assessment of how best to allocate his limited time. In an ideal world, though, I would have liked a more thorough explanation of what he actually did, but that\'s minor issue with me.Anyway he told me recovery takes six weeks and was very pleased with my progress and he let me go without requiring a followup. The incision on my neck is healing extremely well. My shoulder\'s a little sore, more so than my neck for some reason; I wonder if they used extreme pressure on it to immobilize me during surgery. But I can move my neck up down left and right with no pain now. In fact this is the first time I\'ve been able to look up with no pain for about 10 years. My neck still gets tied in the evenings, but I can put in a full day\'s work with no trouble.I\'d say Dr. Andrews and the team he works with are worth every one of the five stars I\'m giving here.'),(3569,289,5,'Dr. Andrews performed microsurgery of the lumbar spine on me last week and my sciatic pain is gone. I am walking about and off of pain meds. In the surgery he corrected my spinal stenosis. When I came out from the anesthetic he looked at me and said Wide Open and Free meaning my nerves were no longer pinched. He said no one should have to live like that. This bedside manner was music to my ears. I thank him for giving me back my mobility.'),(3570,289,5,'Contrary to many of these reviews, I found Dr. Andrews to be very respectful and communicative. He examined me thoroughly, explained my MRI in detail, and carefully explained my options. There was a scheduling snafu on the day of my surgery, and he returned to work to perform it. After surgery, he sat down with my partner and gave him all the details of surgery and recovery, and then visited me in the post op suite to go over it all with me. Although he his not touchy feely, he was very kind, respectful, and professional. Since I had a very large extrusion, I\'m not sure how my back will ultimately hold up, but if I need more intervention, he will be my first choice.'),(3571,289,5,'Indication of permeant nerve damage is a viable reason to operate. He makes the calls on surgery based on serious structural weakness and the ensuing nerve damage rather then pain. His surgical skills are impeccable. He provides accurate information and the delivery can be sharp but this not an issue. I was focused on problem resolution not the delivery of his soft people skills when I was awake. He checked on me post surgery and called me as well. He too suggested that I postpone surgery when I first saw him and a year later with addition symptoms, he agreed that it was time to operate. My internal response at the time too was Why did I have to be in pain for a year?!Pain alone is not a good reason to operate. Pain is often caused by inflammation and if you can get the inflammation down with diet or medication, the pain can go away. Yes he has to deal out the unpopular advise, but its not because he wants you in pain, he doesn\'t want to perform unnecessary surgery. However, he quickly fits patients in when he diagnosis serious structural issues. The professional integrity to not perform inappropriate surgery before its time despite seeing his patient in pain should be applauded not chided.'),(3572,289,5,'I learned more in 30 minutes from Dr Andrew\'s than 2 years at other doctor offices. I should have come here back in the day.... looking forward to getting well & moving forward.'),(3573,289,1,'I became a Yelper just so I could write a review on this Dr. and let everyone know that they need to find someone else if they are looking to find a doctor who is patient, understanding, and someone who really cares about his patients. Dr. Andrews is NOT the one! Yes, he seems to be the name dropped by other doctors and he may be knowledgeable in his field, but his bedside manner is horrible! I have a herniated L4L5 disc with stenosis and had terrible pain radiating down my right leg. I ended up seeing Dr. Andrews after three ER doctors recommended him to me. My first visit with him lasted about 10 minutes and most of it was Dr. Andrews trying to convince me to have surgery. I literally ran out of there and did not look back. Unfortunately, after several months of continued excruciating pain I ended back in the ER and had no other option but to return to see him. I had surgery microdiscectomy in April 08 as I could no longer deal with the pain. Dr. Andrews told me I would be back to normal within 68 weeks and it took me a long and slow 5 months to be able to go back to work parttime. Dr. Andrews never bothered to come and see me in the hospital in which I was in for 2 days, and his first followup appointment was 6 weeks POST surgery! He didn\'t even bother to call and see if I was still alive! I continued to see him regularly as I still had pain and each time I did I felt hurried and rushed at the appointments. He never once said, I\'m so sorry you are still dealing with this. He never smiled, and he never made me feel like he really cared about me. I felt that he was most interested in making $$ from my healthplan and when I complained about pain his answer was a new prescription, e.g. Voltaren, Prednisone, Percocet, Flexraril, Motrin and his usual phrase, it\'s a slow process.In Oct 08 he told me that he no longer needed to see me, unless there was an issue. Even though I stated that I had chronic back pain, he saidback surgery is a slow recovery. I tried to accept it and managed each day somehow. When I recently decided to go see him 14 months post surgery because of my continued lower back pain I got the same cold, bitter and hurried doctor, but I never expected to hear what I did from him. When I explained that I was still experiencing pain, he boldly stated YOU JUST HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE WITH IT. He then went about saying that 10% of patients with my type of herniation continue to have pain post surgery. When I tried to discuss some alternatives, he stated I can no longer be your treating physician. I have a very busy practice, and there is nothing else I can do for you. I am referring you to another doctor. I was so dumb founded and shocked that I just left his office on the verge of tears. Once I got to the safety of my car I totally lost it. I cried so much, not because of my pain, but because of his ruthless and cold behavior and conduct. I have never felt so hurt by the words, especially from a doctor. I am seriously writing a letter to the Board and CPMC. So, save yourself the grief of dealing with someone who doesn\'t care and don\'t go see him!I am NOT going to see the doctor he recommended, and I\'m a search for a new one. I still have hope that my pain will go away and I will continue trying out new things until I have exhausted all options.'),(3574,289,1,'Dr. Andrews performed THREE back surgeries on me in 2006. [ONE because he was so highly recommended; TWO more because he screwed up EVERY time. I ended up needing a FOURTH surgery, which I had done at Stanford Hospital with Dr. Jon Park, which fixed my back.]Having read through the other reviews, a few things seem obvious:1 either you LOVE him and give 5 stars or you HATE him and give 1 star. Not much in between. [of course, when back pain is relieved, one will kiss the feet of whomever relieved such pain ... so if it worked, he is a HERO; if he fails, you don\'t want to be dealing with Dr. Andrews! 2 Dr. Andrews is one of the coldest human beings I\'ve ever met. Period. and most of the reviews back up such On the arrogant, obnoxious, godlikecomplex scale .. he certainly is near a \'10\'.3 Dr. Andrews is a doctor for the MONEY!

This doctor tries to do as many surgeries as humanly possible .. and then very aggressively tries to minimize his time spent on all other aspect outside of his cashmaking operating room. so very little time for Q&A, followup, bedside manner, whateverTo be fair ..

People in pain travel from all over the country to see this doc, so its not easy to get in. But if you do, you will get some of the best medical advice available.He\'s a busy man in high demand, so he\'s a straight shooter. But he did fit in my last surgery on his lunch hour when I was in such gripping pain that I simply couldn\'t wait months for an available spot. And for that I will be forever thankful.Andrews did both of my lumbar microdisectomy operations 8 yrs apart and both were successful. And I held out for a long, painful time before getting either of them. I tried everything else  and I mean everything  but for me, surgery was the best option and I discovered later that Dr Andrews is regarded as top in his field.If you\'ve got severe back or neck pain, I strongly reco the following regimen while you wait to get in with Dr Andrews: Start 600800mg Ibuprofen for 3x a day steady for at least 3 wks  don\'t stop if you feel better, the inflamation causing the pain can take weeks to go away and ibuprofen is an excellent overthecounter med for this purpose  just take it with a little food to protect your tummy. Add in 1015 minute ice packs along with the ibuprofen. Lastly, talk to your primary doc about using a antidepressant for short term pain management  some can virtually eliminate pain Welbutrin did for me and buy you time for the inflamation to go down naturally. Follow this regimen, and if you are lucky, you may be able to cancel your appt with Andrews by the time it comes around.'),(3576,289,5,'Two back surgeries and I cannot say enough about Dr. Andrew\'s. He is the best there is. After dealing with other inept neurologists, Dr. Andrew\'s laid out the options and his technique was amazing.

He saved me from unnecessary trauma. He also operated on my 85 year old Grandmother and gave her relief that no other surgeon I met could have done. Thank you Dr. Andrew\'s. On the reviews that say he is cold, that is not true. He is factual which I prefer.'),(3577,289,1,'I urge you to contact me before letting Dr. Andrews operate on you. He performed a microdiscectomy on me a year ago and my pain is much worse than before the surgery. I am devastated. The procedure was a complete failure and my disc reherniated within months. There are other options to address this particular issue. He may be technically skilled, but has zero demonstrable compassion and doesn\'t listen to his patients.

I had extreme sciatic pain, I couldn\'t even walk at some points. He identified what the problem was after looking at my MRI, something that other doctors I had seen were unable to do. I had a quick recovery from surgery, and am very glad I went to see him.In the matters of the negative reviews; yes, Andrews is not much of the bed side manners; he is straight business, which is what I want from a neurosurgeon.People complain that it takes a long time to see him. This is because he is GOOD, and therefor booked. I had to take a delay in an appointment. Why? Emergency brain surgery apparently. I would not be a good person if I complained about this.He is amazing at what he does. He was able to correctly deduce what the issue was in my back when other doctors could not, and he fixed it. Others complain that they are not fixed after surgery, and give Andrews a negative review; surgery does not always fix the problem entirely. Amazing doctor, and I liked him. He is a good guy, I had no issues with his attitude. My wife likes him too. Highly recommended, especially if you want to make sure your surgery is done right.'),(3579,289,1,'My experience with Dr. Andrews was short, helpful, and disturbing. He kicked me out after giving me some useful information. I consider it a net gain, and, as a friend who accompanied me said, if I learned that he had a diagnosis of Asperger\'s, I would not be surprised. His communication difficulties and unusual personal discomfort with me were striking. First, he would not let me say say anything about why I was there. He took rigid control from the moment he walked into the room, and would not even look at me. He asked a series of questions and was very impatient with my attempt to mention anything he did not ask. He asked about symptoms and I thought it was important to mention that I was an outlier as far as pain goes. I don\'t get pain until things are irredeemably damaged. But he didn\'t want to hear anything that was not a specific response to a question. My husband, who was also there, said it sounded like he was reading from a script, as if he had learned to talk to people by rote and could not deviate from the script. I got a lot of very useful information from him, including the information that symptoms other than pain would indicate permanent nerve damage. This was a relief. He also went through my MRI with me, which I found helpful. He didn\'t get how parsing an MRI might be difficult for me, but was willing, thankfully, to answer a question I asked by pointing to an xray that I had brought along. I was delighted that he did not advocate fusion, which was what I was trying to avoid. In fact, I had done a lot of research looking for fusion alternatives and I had an idea of what I wanted. What he suggested was what I had hoped for, but an even better version of what I thought was possible. All that was helpful in answering the question about whether I needed fusion surgery right away or at all. I was ready to buy. However, we never got to the important discussion of whether there was a downside to doing the surgery now. Suddenly, without my having said much of anything, he told me it was clear that I was very nervous about getting treatment. I was taken aback and to be honest, confronted him a little. I said, You haven\'t let me talk, you haven\'t been willing to listen to me. I\'m not scared of surgery at all. I\'ve had lots of it and always with good outcomes. I don\'t get postsurgical pain. I\'m right back on my feet. The surgery that you\'re talking about is exactly what I would be willing to do, based on my own research. His face didn\'t changehe has almost no affect. He sort of drew back, and said, I\'m not comfortable with you and I\'m not going to offer you treatment. Then he fled. WTF? He\'s not comfortable with me? He really came off as a fragile, childlike personality, someone who has to structure their interactions very carefully so as not to deal with people and their feelings and their ragged thought processes too much. In my case, I had done a lot of research and preparation for the appointment, and had a short bullet list of concerns which any surgeon without a personality disorder would want to hear about, for instance that while the research and other doctors I had consulted focused on pain relief, I was concerned primarily with mobility. I had a referral to him, and my PT also thought he was good. I certainly learned somethingthe name of the procedure about which I could ask other surgeons Weber at CPMC and Tay at UC come to mind, the one that answered my concerns though that was a complete accident, since he didn\'t hear them. But I\'m glad he chose to throw his hissy fit on the first appointment, not, as with another poor reviewer, after having performed an unsuccessful surgery. No matter how godlike a surgeon is, he\'s not the one for me if he is that threatened by someone speaking up for themselves. I can deal with arrogance. That\'s no big deal if there\'s something backing it up. But this was something not normal, some emotional problem that goes beyond a lack of bedside manner. It\'s more like a mental condition, something having to do with a communication deficit, which makes this doctor absurdly fragile. Not for me, and I guess I scared him pretty bad, too.'),(3580,289,4,'I had terrible pain and inflammation of the neck 5 years ago, was losing strength in my left triceps to an alarming and frightening degree, and was told about Brian Andrews.

So I have dealt with numerous surgeons.I suffer from chronic pain in various parts of my body and see several doctors for various conditions. I have been seeing Dr Andrews the past few years for degenerative discs in my neck. Frankly I was terrified of having this surgeryremoval of 3 discs and fusing of the neck and after reading some of the comments here and nightmarish stories about this type of surgery on forums on line I kept putting off my surgery. I did a lot of research the last few years and everyone I talked toDrs in other specialties, nurses etc Dr Andrews name kept coming up as the foremost neurosurgeon on the west coast. I also found out that he had operated on some other doctors including the knee specialist I was seeing.Well I finally went ahead and had the surgery on Feb 14 at the Davies campus of CPMC and this surgery went better than my previous 9. Dr Andrews visited my significant other after the surgery and explained to her that everything went well technically. The two days I was in the hospital he came and checked up on me daily. Now I wish I had not waited this long. This gentleman has magic fingers. I think he may seem cool to some but that is because he is overwhelmed due to high demand and has to concentrate on the technical aspects of the complicated cases he is dealing with. I was amazed with his energy level. He has always been courteous and professional towards me and so have his office staff.I wish the 9 other surgeons who operated on me were as proficient as Dr Andrews. In fact a few years ago I was misled by the charm of an orthopedist Dr Eugene Wolf who ruined my right knee in a simple orthopedic procedure which goes to show sometimes the ones who are charming with great bedside manners are not the best doctors. Dr Andrews is also very frank. He told me before the surgery not to expect miracles because of the condition of my nerves and my putting off surgery for years. He told me you should expect about 60% relief in this area and so on unlike some of the other doctors I had gone to for second and third opinions.In closing, if you need a neurosurgeon consider yourself lucky if you are treated by this gentleman!'),(3584,290,5,'In a nutshell: professional.She actually cares for patients and does not try to rip you off.

I was so impressed. Thank you Dr. Kim for helping me!'),(3588,290,5,'My review on Dr. Theresa Kim is long overdue, seriously. I must start out by saying that she is the best doctor ever. I have had my fair share of ENT MD\'s, and she is by far the best. I went to to Dr. Kim after my primary care doctor was acting a little nutty after reading some information by the American Medical Association and refused to give me antibiotics. My primary care doctor\'s explanation was that antibiotics are bad for you, and you should just wait it out. After being in pain for a week and a half, I decided to ditch her and call Dr. Kim\'s office. Here is my breakdown of my experience with her. Pros:1 Office staff is very friendly, professional, and courteous. They were also able to get me an appoinment the same day. The same is also true for followup visits. 2 Dr. Kim has a wonderful bedside manner. Always shakes your hand, looks in the office, and always explains things so that you can understand them. 3 Dr. Kim gives great referrals. I have asked her for many referrals, to which she has gladly given me. I no longer utilize my primary care doctor, or any east bay physician for that matter. 4 Dr. Kim saved me from a medical disaster. I started out with a sinus infection, and Dr. Kim gave me my antibiotics, which worked beautifully for the first 3 days. Halfway through the treatment, the inflammation and the pain came back with a vengeance. I called Dr. Kim\'s office, and she advised me to come in for a CT scan immediately. I thought that this was drastic, but figured she was the expert, so I had better listen. I am so glad that I did. Turned out I had a huge mass and some other funky stuff going on in my sinus\' that required surgery. Dr. Kim sent me to go have a 2nd opinion who advised me that she Dr. Kim was spot on, and that surgery was definitely needed asap.5 I definitely grew to trust and respect Dr. Kim and her team, so when she said surgery was needed  I didn\'t even freak out, get scared, or doubt what she said. I knew that she knew what she was talking about and I felt completely comfortable with her. I had no anxiety whatsoever when I walked in to the surgery center. Dr. Kim met me there, and explained everything for the 2nd time as she had also done so in my presurgery consultation with her. The prepostsurgery care was impeccable. She called me at home to make sure I was okay. She took the time to answer any and all questions. The same is also true for the anesthesiologist who also worked with Dr. Kim. 6 I am healed. Dr. Kim completely alleviated all of my symptoms and then some. She identified and corrected conditions I didn\'t even know I had in addition to the original sinus infection. Now how is that for impeccable medical care?7 Dr. Kim accepts my insurance! Yay for me. Her office took care of all of the authorizations and insurance issues. No sweat here. 8 She has the CT scanner in her office. That made things very convenient. She looks at your CT scan and goes over your results in the same day. Cons:1 Dr. Kim\'s office doesn\'t have AC, so it can get hot up there. Fortunately, this does not happen too often. 2 I had an issue with Dr. Kim\'s billing company, Brown and Toland. I paid almost $300 towards my medical bill and they kept telling me that I didn\'t pay it, and they were not even willing to research the issue. After 2 weeks of faxing proof which they said they never received, even though I have the confirmations and still no resolution, I called Dr. Kim. Within the hour presto! Brown and Toland found my payment and all was right with the world. I told Dr. Kim that from then on I would make any and all payments directly to her office. She said that would be fine. Haven\'t had any billing problems since.Bottom Line: Dr. Kim is a wonderful, state of the art, one of a kind physician. She really did help me out by taking care of a lot of problems all at once. I would recommend her to anyone with any ENT issues. I will definitely go back to her and suggest you do the same. She is by far the best doctor I have ever had. I highly recommend her.'),(3589,290,5,'I just found Dr. Kim on a google search to be honest. She had an open appointment when I was available.  So I arrived at the office and her assistant Natalie arrived and she was very prompt and took some preliminary info. Shortly there after, Dr. Kim arrived and she was so easy to talk to and listened to what I had to say. Instead of just looking at the issue and making a determination. She proposed some test to try and figure out what was going on which I agreed with. She explained everything very clearly in terms I could understand I am not a doctor..ha ha. Then within a couple days, she called to give me a progress report on some of the tests and suggested 2 paths to take. it\'s nice having options. I took the lease invasive path for now and that was good with her. So I feel as if I have found an ENT for life if needed.

It was determined pretty quickly that her adenoids needed to be removed and we scheduled surgery immediately. Dr. Kim explained everything clearly and did not hesitate to answer questions along the way. After we checked into the hospital, Dr. Kim stopped by in her scrubs right before surgery to see if we had questions. She engaged my daughter and put her at ease as much as one can be at ease prior to having surgery. After surgery, she called the next day to check in which we really appreciated. When I had to call back with a question, one of the staff in the office got right to Dr. Kim and got back to me with an answer promptly. Finally, during our postop checkup, Dr. Kim spent a good amount of time talking with my daughter after she checked her out physically when she easily could have left the room immediately after all looked good.

I recommend her highly!'),(3604,291,5,'It has been about 3 weeks after my PRK procedure and I could not recommend Pacific Vision Institute PVI more highly. Having worn glasses since middle school, I have forgotten what it is like to go about my everyday life without them. The only benefit of wearing glasses for me was that if I needed to squash a nasty bug, I could take my glasses off and turn it into an unidentifiable blurry dot. Going from Clark Kent to Superman of smashing bugs hardly outweighed the cons. Wearing glasses in the rain is the worst!Once I decided to get corrective surgery for my vision I started my research. I sifted through yelp reviews, talked to friends and coworkers who have gone through the procedure, and asked my optometrist for the lowdown on the whole procedure which lead me to PVI. I was initially a little taken back by the 1 and 2 star reviews on Yelp, but I decided to read through each one to make sure I knew everything about who was going to handle my eyes. The majority of these reviews had a beef with the sales pitch, but inquiring about payment is a necessary step for a business, especially for such a costly procedure.Upon inquiring about a consultation via email, I received an response from Stephennie, their Patient Care Coordinator. She asked me questions to know my history with glasses and contacts and shipped me eye drops to take a week prior to my to my appointment. Consultation  My consultation began with talking to Stephennie about the types of corrective surgeries, the procedures, recovery and their success rate. I then met with their clinical manager Gene, and got topographic maps taken of my eye. I picked his brain on the different laser technology, machine maintenance, calibration and reliability. Trusting the laser is just as important as trusting the doctor because during the treatment your vision is in the hands of a computer. Gene explained my maps to me and said that my cornea the outer layer of my eye is thick enough to to receive LASIK, however the shape of my eye raised some concerns and that I might need PRK. I then saw Dr. Quan who checked my vision and looked at my eyes in more detail and explained why PRK was ideal for me.There are essentially two corneal procedures that you can go through to get your vision corrected: LASIK and PRK. LASIK involves creating a flap on your eye that is then lifted up before the laser reshapes that eye. The flap is then lowered back over the eye and the patient\'s vision is clear. The patient can typically go back to work the next day.Unlike LASIK, the PRK does not create a flap but removes the cornea\'s outer layer and procedure is done on the surface of the cornea. This process takes longer to recover, but yields a similar result.Based on Dr. Faktorovich\'s diagnosis of my eyes, I decided to move forward with PRK. I scheduled the procedure, I got my prescription eye drops fulfilled and showed up at PVI the day of with my dad. The Surgery The procedure was very quick, less than 10 mins for both eyes! The longest part was putting the numbing eye drops and waiting for them to take affect. Dr. Faktorovich talked to me the whole time and kept my mind at ease.As soon as the process was over my vision was near perfect! Everything was very clear, but I couldn\'t enjoy it too much as they taped eye shields on my face and gave me nifty sunglasses. After my dad drove my home, I passed out for 4 hours and went on to the recover process.Note: If you don\'t have someone to drive you home, PVI provides Uber service! The Recovery  The first week is the hardest. In the first few days you experience dryness, irritation and discomfort, but they weren\'t as bad as the horror stories that i heard. Just make sure you have painkillers on hand just in case. I had 2020 the day after my procedure but my vision dropped off and varied for a week as expected.It takes time for your vision to stabilize after PRK, but my vision has been getting slightly better everyday. I look out my window at work everyday to check my progress and I can finally read the tiny letters on the billboard that my coworkers can\'t read. I have no regrets!'),(3605,291,2,'It took me a long time to be able to write this because I wanted to ensure that I covered all my bases and gave the fairest judgement. This definitely isn\'t something to be taken lightly as it\'s a life changing procedure. However, almost 2 years has passed since my surgery so I think I\'ve been given enough time.I didn\'t qualify for Lasik and had gone to quite a few doctors here and overseas. All said PRK was my best chance. When asking around eye doctors here in the bay area everyone said Dr. Faktorovich and her magic machine were going to be my best bet. Not to mention, I live in the city and wanted something convenient. I don\'t have comparison since I\'ve only done PRK once at this place so I\'ll have to trust the machine is as good as they say it is I won\'t ever know. Do I regret doing the surgery? No way. Do I still have issues with my sight and dry eyes? Yes. However, to be able to wake up and more or less relatively be able to see...is something I\'m extremely thankful for.With that being said, the staff is probably the most incompetent staff I have ever come across. My follow up doctor set the worst expectations and it was only until my last check up 3 months ago when I had a different doctor that he said healing time can take up to a year and a half. My original follow up person told me that some people were driving in 5 days. Now I understand that everyone heals incredibly differently but that is a huge difference. In addition, she kept changing her story of healing time every time I came in stretching it out to 6 months a year, etc. It\'s one thing to explain that there is a long healing time and everyone is different but you should not set expectations as the norm being you can driveresume regular activity within less than a week. If I were her I\'d set lower expectations. I had to take extra time off work because of her unrealistic expectations.In addition, because you are essentially out of it the first 4 days, I had to have family fly in to help me. They cancelled my reservation less than a month before my surgery after all tickets were booked and rescheduled me for 2 weeks earlier. I\'m noticing that since I had the surgery a lot of people seemed to have the same complaints as me and my only wish is that I had seen this sooner. For how expensive they are I wish I had given my money to people that actually care about patients. In addition, there\'s no way my right eye is 2020 but my last check up he insisted that I was even though I could barely see the 1st line. In the grand scheme of things, yes it\'s great to be able to see way better but for at least one eye, I wish I\'d just kept the contacts. Surgery aside, this was the most frustrating, worst customer carebedside manners I have ever experienced and I would not recommend them. Now, normally customer service is something that I\'d brush off but given that you have so many follow ups in your first 18 months, it does make a difference. All I\'m saying is do your research, PVI has consistently the most up to date technology but since doing my surgery I\'ve heard great things about Hyver, Stanford, etc. It\'s definitely a big decision so I\'ll just leave you with the fact to do your research and weigh what\'s important to you pre, during and post surgery. Good luck!'),(3606,291,2,'A hard pressed 2 stars, I may be generous here.Overall if you want a very good eye surgeon then yes, go to Dr. Faktorovich.If you want to be treated well, deal with a competent staff, have your concerns addressed, have good thorough and responsible follow up care, have a doctor that is a participant in your care, then RUN AWAY. Really fast.I\'ll just nutshell it since my bad experiences with them could fill a small book. Let\'s just say that for my circumstances Dr. Faktorovich was my best bet, and I do think she\'s a great surgeon. I have no beef with her. It\'s her staff that\'s the problem. And yes, I understand she hires them, or runs the place, whatever. But my experiences with them are that they\'re unprofessional, inept, incompetent, occasionally rude, insensitive, manipulative, and inattentive. I save that for last because in medical you need to be extremely attentive. You have people\'s health, and in this case vision, at stake. Information, detail and timing are critical and this staff don\'t seem to care, don\'t take their mistakes seriously and there are many mistakes and don\'t take responsibility for the errors.If you want details go ahead and get in touch with me. I\'m happy to share, but I\'d be going on for ever if I wrote it all here.I leave you with this again  if you don\'t mind having to micro manage everything, get it ALL in writing, follow up on every detail during the entire process, check and double check the info you get from the staff about pre and post op care, expenses, micro manage your post op then yeah. Go to PVI. Otherwise, find a place that\'s going to appreciate and respond to their responsibilities, and appreciate you as a patient and customer.'),(3607,291,5,'*For quick proscons and update on my vision jump to bottom.OVERALL: I highly recommend PVI if you are considering refractive surgery.BACKGROUND CHECK: Before making the big decision, I instinctively jumped on yelp to check out other yelpers\' experiences and thoughts on PVI. 4star rating over all = looks good so far but most recent reviews are 1 star ... now I am conflicted. So I rolled up my sleeves and actually read each review thoroughly, since my vision is on the line. The main gripe from the 1 star review was the sales pitch.Honestly, a sale pitching or having an employee inquire how I am about to pay for an expensive but lifechanging procedure does not bother me. Those questions are reasonable, especially for and an elective surgery. What I am more concerned with is PVI\'s ability to answer my questions and care for my eyes and vision. After reading the Yelp reviews, I reached out to my best friend, a licensed optometrist, for his opinion on LASIK and PVI. My girlfriend, a soontobe optometrist, yelled at me for not asking her first. Lesson learned, ask your girlfriend first! She made me say that part. After consulting with both of them, and learning that PVI had the latest technology in LASIK with an extremely skilled and renowned surgeon, I scheduled my consult.CONSULTATION: The staff and optometrist at PVI are capable, friendly, and direct. I truly value their honestly and willingness to address all of my concerns. During the consult my curiosity got the best of my and I asked about a previous PVI customer who voiced his poor experience on Yelp. Instead of brushing my question aside, PVI reassured me that person does have fantastic visual acuity and PVI was willing to perform enhancements, as long as it is safe for your eyes. This showed me that PVI cares about my vision and making sure that I am making an informed decision. After the Q&A, and hours of reading terrifying LASIK complications, I decided that I could trust PVI and scheduled a preop appointment.PREOP: An exceptional optometrist greeted me with a friendly smile and gave me the scoop on LASIK, as I tried to get some dirt on the establishment. He told me that since he started working there he has seen hundreds of thousands of patients and none of them had complications. I was reassured and he proceeded to screen me for and take my measurements for LASIK. He is very professional and thorough. Only thing that could make this better was if Dr. F would come and talk to me.DAY OF SURGERY: I was prepared. I knew the risks. I even had a friend who just had the procedure tell me exactly what to expect. Most important advice I received is to take the pill to help you relax. Despite my preparation, I was really nervous that morning and swallowed that pill the instant I saw it. Unfortunately it took effect after the procedure, but it was a good thing because you needed to keep your eyes close 4 hours after, so it helped me nap. I met with the optometrist who prepared me for my procedure and marked up my eyes. Many eye drops later, I was ready for surgery. Dr. F introduced herself and told me that I was in good hands. Listening to her instructions of you are doing well just keep staring at the green light during the 1015 minute procedure help reduce my anxiety. Afterwards, I was then led back to the optometrist for a quick check and given a postop pack and sent home.

I was waiting to see how things turned out before I posted & final result is average. I was led to believe my vision would be perfect after surgery which is why I am disappointed as it is average, and the final result does not seem worth the cost. As other people have noted the sales tactic was completely over the top! I actually thought the sales person was the Doctor, but obviously a professional as she knew how to close. She knew I was balking at $6800 price tag, so she did hard pressured sales tactic and pushed hard to close so bizarre! Although to give credit it worked, although in retrospect I wish I had gone with my gut that said no. I actually only saw Dr. In operating room for 20 min, maybe less. It is amazing to wake up & see without glasses after all those years but for me the expense wasn\'t worth it especially since eyes have regressed. My husband had surgery & was a believer but I am not sure worth it. My eyes are now 2540 so not sure much better than before although haven\'t been to ophthalmologist yet to check but I do see glassescontacts in my future. I only saw Dr. F during surgery briefly very short procedure & rest of time it is very young Doctors & staff you interact with. All very nice but was odd to me that you don\'t see Doctor after surgery as with some other procedures I have seen surgeon for follow up, usually the surgeon comes in to check work for a few minutes after lower staff review.  I talked to PVI about a touch up on right eye but they seemed to think it was not needed, but it is clear to me that my right eye is off in vision. I think that should happened awhile ago as my eyes have been in same place for awhile but they seemed to be putting me off & truthfully not sure want to go through the surgery again. Even though very brief it is uncomfortable and a bit of an ordeal. I can see benefit of surgery for people in military, pilots, doctors but for average active person like me although nice to have, not necessary. I have wasted money on worse things but if I had to do over I would not spend the money on this as almost a year out and my final result was average. I can see without lenses but my right eye is off, so in the not too distant future I know I will need corrective lenses which seems like a waste after this surgery.

I just had my LASIK procedure done this morning literally 6 hours ago by Dr. Faktorovich and her staff at PVI. The fact that I\'m writing a 5star Yelp review this quickly should tell you many things unto itself, but here are a few bullet points I\'d like to highlight updates to follow1 I had a relatively light prescription with astigmatism, and 6 hours after the procedure, I have no pain or discomfort and can see everything. Like, everything. I took my new eyeballs out for a walk just to test them out. It was like wearing my glasses, only with a little hazyness to be expected from the postop instructions. I\'m told its only going to get better, which is hard to believe, because it\'s pretty incredible now. 2 The alllaser LASIK procedure I had done was truly painless. You don\'t feel the lasers doing their thing, as your eyes are numbed. The only discomfort you feel is from the clamps they put on your eyes, and its moderate and brief. So if you\'re freaked out about being in all sorts of pain during the procedure, forget about it. Not likely to happen at all. I was in the first laser chair and out of the second in less than 10 minutes. Crazy.3 There are lots of people on yelp who are critical of the sales approach at PVI. True, it can be a little over the top I walked in, and basically said Hi, I\'d like LASIK, please, and still got bombarded with sales pitches, but understand that it\'s an expensive procedure that a lot of people want but aren\'t sure they can justify the investment. 3rd party validation customer success stories aim to serve that purpose, which is why you see books of customer comments all over the office. In summary: if you are extremely sensitive to salespeople, you might feel uncomfortable. If you do enough research, and talk to enough people and decide that you want LASIK provided that you\'re a candidate, you should just do it. And get it done at PVI because Dr. F is the authority. A little sales pitch never hurt anybody, and they have the best laser technology in the world here.

I moved around my schedule took unpaid time off work and was totally invested despite continuing to question why the surgeon herself did not want to meet her patient.

I was amazed at the complete lack of consideration for me and my time. They never even mentioned they might switch on me at the last minute ... I was so deeply disappointed in their lack of caring about their patients! The surgeon never came out to apologize for not giving me this information sooner so I could have been prepared. She had her optometrist give me the news and no one ever even apologized ..I never had the surgery. I could not feel good about giving $7100 to someone who does not care about her patients. I heard that she does 20 surgeries a day and only does surgery 2 days a week...with each surgery ranging from $714,000. At these prices don\'t you think a little bed side manner is well deserved? I have spoken with other people who have had these procedures with other surgeons and who all met the surgeon before their surgery.

I told them I wanted IntraLasik so they didn\'t even go into any other options. Thankfully, I was a perfect candidate for the procedure I wanted. They WILL reject you as a candidate if your cornea is too thin, along with a few other conditions. THIS IS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. Yes, they want a good success rate but WHY would you elect a procedure if you aren\'t a good candidate!? Boggles my mind. End rant. Before the procedure I went through a bunch of tests. Vision, corneal mapping, I can\'t remember what else. None of them are painful. I was given the necessary prescriptions for eye drops have to fill through your own pharmacy and I was ready!Day of procedure: I show up, they give me Atavan antianxiety, I go back to the exam room, they give me numbing eye drops and I\'m taken back into the operating room. I\'m not going to relive the details but let\'s just say ... I\'m glad I only had to do that once in my life. Other reviewers have written indepth summaries. Or do google search. Dr. Lee wasis my followup optometrist. Request him if you can, he is awesome. Plus, he plays hockey. I had a checkup the next day, week, month and I\'m coming up on my 3 month.I couldn\'t be happier with my experience or results! Thank you PVI, Dr. F and Dr. Lee!'),(3621,291,2,'I had PRK surgery done and the results are great  I am seeing around 2020.  While the results are great, the process was a total train wreck. Here are some of my observations:1. If you have PRK surgery, plan for at least three weeks of poor vision with the first week being almost to the point of not being able to function. I was told I would be able to return to work and be functional by Monday or Tuesday following surgery on a Thursday. That was not true. I couldn\'t see to a functional degree for weeks almost a full month after surgery. When I brought this up to the postop doctor, she literally said to me well, there\'s nothing we can do about it now. This was a big case of mismanaged expectations on recovery time and I am just thankful that I didn\'t have to drive to work everyday.2. If you have Kaiser insurance, plan ahead for the prescriptions and they are pricey the Vigamox cost $104, even with my medical coverage.3. The pain over the weekend is as described, but you\'ll get through it.4. I wasn\'t impressed by the staff overall. Other than Dr. F who you see for about 10 minutes total, everyone else was underwhelming.5. If you want to meet Dr. F. during your consultation, you have to explicitly ask to meet her.6. Be prepared to spend a small fortune on eye drops. I definitely spent several hundred dollars on eye drops following my PRK surgery. They say that using the eye drops frequently is the only way to get your eyes to heal more quickly. So, you\'ll be going through many boxes.7. Be prepared for MANY follow up appointments. I was told I would only have a follow up the day after surgery, the week after and then a month after. Well, this wasn\'t true either. I had an appointment almost every week or two for the first three months. This was a huge hassle, considering time off work and the time and cab fare it took to get to the office from work and then to get home.Based on the results, I would do it again. However, I am not sure I would come to PVI. Or, if I did, I would reset my expectations about the process in a big way.'),(3622,291,4,'I had LASIK yesterday and am seeing better than 2020 today! It is unbelievable.I am 26, had worn glasses since the 3rd grade and contacts since the 9th grade. Lately, I started hearing of ecstatic friends and colleagues many of whom are doctors who had LASIK and decided to look into it. Keep in mind, contacts had been fine for many years and this is an elective procedure.As great as the idea sounded, I was pretty scared and had a million questions. I am of the practicalskeptical type. I researched a lot and consulted two practices in SF, but once I visited PVI it was hard to choose anyone else: 99% success rate for 2020, and maybe 6070% for 2015 note that this depends on your eyes\' natural potential  mine did not have the potential for 2015, so 2020 is my best result. They are truly pros at what they do, and gave me the confidence to go with Dr. Faktorovich. Initially a lot of my communication was with the patient coordinators. At times, they seemed overwhelmed by my unending questions and passed me to the doctors. Dr. Lee and Dr. Faktorovich were better able to address my more detailed questions.Despite my nerves, the procedure itself was over before I knew it. Once you are in the chair, everything happens quickly and Dr. Faktorovich is communicative and comforting. There is definite pressure and slight discomfort, but it is absolutely tolerable. I would recommend reading up so you know exactly what to expect. My rating is based on my successful procedure and already amazing results. In conclusion, if you want to rid your glassescontacts and can afford LASIK, definitely go for it. But do it with the best. I have limited $300 coupons if you are serious about it  I know this is a big decision, so please feel free to message me.'),(3623,291,2,'I went through with the eye surgery at Pacific Vision, the results were decent, but they are extremely expensive. The main reason they get low marks from me is based on their sales tactics and lack of attentioncare. I am the type to ask a lot of questions and they answered most of them, but gave me it\'s better you don\'t know answer to a few of them as they thought it would scare me away from having the procedure and they might have been right. I ended up getting some antianxiety medication from PVI but they did not give it time to set in. I was rushed in to the OR despite mentioning that it had been 2 min literally since I took the pills. The procedure was a whirlwind in which time I felt very uncomfortable and experienced quite a bit of fear ever have your cornea seared to black and then scraped off? it is not fun. I would have had a good deal of fear no matter what, but i am disappointed that they were too focused on getting another customer in and out rather than give me some time and proper explanations. After the surgery I was ok for the first day, but due to it being PRK, I had several days of intense pain. This is no fault of PVI, but when i called in to mention how bad it was I could not get out of bed for four days they were indifferent and said there was nothing they could do. They had led me to believe that I would experience mild pain in the consultation and this was unbearable. I would have Laser done again... it is worth it, but not from PVI. They just don\'t care after they have been paid.'),(3624,291,5,'It\'s 2:30 a.m. and I\'m writing a Yelp review because Marc D. has made a request that I get off my duff and not neglect my reviews.It\'s been a little over three weeks since my procedure with Dr. Faktorovich and I\'m going to be just like one those annoying after people right now. There\'s a before person who\'s usually chubby, unhappy, in need of makeup and a little sun and there\'s an after person who\'s smiling, bubbly, young, attractive and loving life. Thanks to this amazing investment in myself, I feel like an after picture!I\'ll admit that I didn\'t do much research when it came to getting eye surgery done. I merely went on the recommendation of my trusted optometrist and a peer who\'s sole job was to teach people how to live without glasses. My sister\'s own surgery and recovery almost made me run for the hills with how groggy she was after surgery and how much of an invalid she became, but my annoyance with glasses and contacts outweighed the memories of her recovery. I had corneal scarring in both eyes and I open my eyes during my sleep so they were always dry and irritated in the morning so I went in for a consultation with almost no faith that they could do anything for me. Thankfully I hadn\'t worn contacts for months though because apparently they did a lot of damage unbeknownst to me. When your doctor says to 1. not sleep in them 2. only wear them for the recommended amount of time 3. clean and sanitize your everything, they mean it for a good reason.I had a consult with their salesperson as is customary so I could discuss payment options 2 years with 0% finance by the way and have my cornea mapped out over and over again. I had spent about an hour with their technician before meeting again with the salesperson. Luckily, I still had a thick enough cornea that I wasn\'t going to have to do the PRK and just continue with the traditional IntraLasik. Looking over the information packet gave me enough to help make an informed decision by the time I walked through the doors and surgery was scheduled on my birthday. My surgery was only 50 minutes from the time I walked in the door to the time I was shaking Dr. Faktorovich\'s hand blindly before being lead out. She talks to you through every step of the procedure and her staff literally takes you by the hand for every step of the recovery also. I was instructed to try and not open my eyes for 4 hours after the surgery so after eating breakfast, I decided to force a nap in and woke up in the afternoon being able to see 2020 for the first time in over 20 years. I don\'t care what they naysayers have to say about how pricey Dr. Faktorovich is but I respect a professional who doesn\'t spread herself thin, doesn\'t offer radio ad deals and at the same time, has nothing but recommendations from other eye doctors in the area. Other Lasik doctors might have the endorsement from athletes but I\'d want my doctor to have the endorsement of my eye doctor more. I genuinely feel that she sees you as a person and not a dollar sign like some other doctors might. She remembered my sister\'s surgery from two years ago and kept comparing how different our behaviors were in surgery. I apparently am the good sister. For anyone who\'s ever thought about getting it done but was hesitant because of cost, potential pain, or because they\'re too lazy to do it, then I\'d strongly suggest calling or emailing for their giant brochure so you can further educate yourself on the process. I don\'t have to worry about glasses, prescription sunglasses, contacts, contact solution, eye appointments for a prescription or contact cases anymore.Being able to see was definitely the best birthday present ever and it\'s literally given me a new outlook on life.'),(3625,291,2,'My review is based only on the free consultation, not the actual procedure, as I have not yet decided how I would like to move forward.Pros:* Nice office with nice people* The consultation is freeCons:* The consultation took about an hour, which was about 55 minutes of sales tactics that were reminiscent of the type of fluff and bully techniques you experience at a 24 hour fitness or a used car sales lot. The last 5 minutes was the actual test to see if I was a candidate, which I am. The sales people are way too pushy, and seem to care too much about commission, which made my experience uncomfortable. They pushed me for a deposit on the spot, kept asking why I wouldn\'t make a decision right then and there, and talked egotistically about how awesome they are. * The consultation seemed to occur in reverse order. During the 55 minute sales pitch I was given way too many details about the different operations that I may or may not be a candidate for, and the step by step instructions for the entire process e.g. \'on week X you use more eye drops\'.. TMI. They acted as if I had already signed up for the treatment refer to last bullet point on sales tactics. A lot of the information was moot after my 5 minute exam.* About a week after my consultation I received an email that I thought was a spamming phish email, but is actually from PVI:How are you doing? I hope everything is fantastic! I just wanted to inform you that Dr. Faktorovich will be conducting a study for a selected few patients for the month of April. The study involves the same steps just more follow up appointments to overlook the recovery of your eyes and healing of the epithelial layer. The procedure is also at a lower rate since we are asking to see you more. : The rate would be $5,500.00 for the procedure and must be scheduled for the month of April. She will be accepting a limited amount of patients, so please let me know ASAP if you would like to be apart of this amazing project!Summary: They claim they have 100% success rate, but since VSP doesn\'t cover as much as I thought it would, I am going to do more research before selecting a place. They need to calm down on the sales techniques, it\'s inappropriate.'),(3626,291,5,'My optometrist initially referred me to Dr. Faktorovich, so I was pretty open to at least having a consultation at PVI. I read all the reviews, then went into my consultation, and I basically felt so at ease with the staff and Dr. Faktorovich that I pretty much signed on right after the consultation.I had my LASIK procedure done last week, and it couldn\'t have gone more smoothly. Not only were they able to accommodate my constantly changing schedule, but they did so with the highest level of care and customer service.A good tip for those of you who don\'t have a ride there and back on the day of your procedure, ask for their car service! It\'ll save you the hassle of finding someone to pick you up after the procedure, or paying an exorbitant fare for a taxi ride back home.LASIK\'s a big commitment, so if you have any questions, feel free to drop me a line, but based on how I\'m seeing now, I couldn\'t recommend PVI more highly. Should my visionexperience change, I\'ll update this review as necessary. Until then, go with PVI for LASIK, it\'s an investment that will pay dividends immediately! :D'),(3627,291,1,'I had one eye lasik\'d here, so this is a real review. DO NOT WASTE YOUR VALUABLE TIME OR $$$ HERE.A mess from the beginning. During my presurgery appointment, they didn\'t tell me that they were going to dialate my eyes, which was a problem since I was on my motorcycle.They lied to me and told me that it would be easy to do one eye at a time. Turns out that after they did one eye, I couldn\'t wear glasses pop out the lens in the corrected eye, which is needed before doing the 2nd surgery, as that causes double vision. They knew this and didn\'t tell me. So, without a choice, I went 5 days before the 2nd surgery with one blurry eye  which meant not going to work, driving, or being able to read. Then, the DAY OF SURGERY, they canceled the appointment!! They had scheduled a laser tuning, who knows how long ago, but didn\'t think to tell me in advance.This place is incredibly unprofessional and the staff is completely incompetent. Spare yourself and see someone else. They charge on the very high end of the spectrum and do not deliver.'),(3628,291,5,'It\'s been exactly 3.5 years since I\'ve had lasik eye surgery and I can still see perfectly. My vision is better than 2020 and I can honestly say that getting the surgery done was the best decision I ever made. I don\'t take my eyes lightly and neither should you. How did I find them? Well, my childhood friend had her surgery done here and 1 full year after her surgery, when she still had good results, I checked them out. Even if she hadn\'t recommended me to them, I would have still found them because my optometrist had also recommended them.I read through all the low rating reviews on here and I find it so funny that all those ratings are from people who never actually had their surgery here.Yes, my friend gave me a $300 discount coupon, but no, she did not receive compensation for it. They mailed her a thank you card for recommending me and that was it.Compensation or no compensation, I certainly wouldn\'t recommend a place to friends and family if they did a horrible job. The real reason people pass on the discount coupon is because they want to help their friends and family save money. If a place did poor work, I wouldn\'t recommend them no matter how much they paid me. That being said, Pacific Vision Institute did a fantastic job.At my consultation appointment, I did not receive any pressure from staff. In fact, when I told them I wanted to postpone my surgery after they checked my eyes with a machine and showed me my eyes were very dry, they were very accommodating. They didn\'t try to pressure me to do the surgery any sooner than I wanted to. Weeks later, after consistently taking the eye vitamins that they gave me to make my eyes less dry, I had my eyes checked by the same machine, and this time my eyes were looking good not dry like before, so I went ahead and scheduled surgery.I was very nervous, but during the surgery, Dr. Faktorovich was so reassuring. I am so glad that she kept repeating comforting words over and over. It really helped me to stay calm. The surgery did not hurt.I didn\'t have anyone able to drive me, but the staff had already called a cab for me for after the surgery. They walked me to the cab and I made my way home to lay down for 4 hours. It was difficult not to peek, but I had my eyes closed most of the time. Plus I was wearing the protective sunglasses they gave me.It\'s now 3.5 years later and I am still confident in my decision to go with them.My sister wants to have surgery done too, but she hasn\'t gotten around to it yet.I also read the review from someone who was told he was not a good candidate. Sometimes it\'s best to heed those words. If you want, get multiple other opinions, but if you already heard from one place that says you\'re not a good candidate, make sure you don\'t just go to the first place that says you\'re an okay candidate. My sister\'s friend went someplace else not here and he now warns everyone about having lasik because he had bad results. He wasn\'t a good candidate in the first place but yet he still had the surgery.I was working at a company that had FSA eligible expenses, so I was able to pay for my surgery with pretax money. I would check with HR if I was you. Hope this helped.'),(3629,291,1,'At times you\'re reminded that we live in America and medicine is a business. From the optometrist that takes a referral fee to the sales staff that will try to sell you health services. My personal experience at Pacific Vision Institute was an extremely poor one. Note, my review does not mention medical competency. In my own research the physicians at PVI seem of extremely high quality. However I would never know as mine didn\'t show up.CheckInFront Desk: Pros: PoliteCons: No outline of visit, No expectation settingI was booked for an hourlong consultation I arrived 10minutes prior to appointment as instructed to complete routine paperwork. Staff was polite and courteous. An outline of what to expect during my visit was not given to me over the phone or in person. Preliminary Exam: Pros: Polite, ThoroughCons: Unprepared, 20minutes late, Poor communication with other groupsThe internist was 20minutes late with no apology. His demeanor was polite, professional, and thorough as we went through an eye exam that include routine and specialized tests. He was unaware that I was referred by my optometrist and was not given my medical record that they passed over ten days prior. Sales:Pros: PoliteCons: Deceptive sale practices The coordinator, or saleswoman was at lunch when I arrived. I saw her out of order with no contacts in due to the test I went through the with the intern. Her function is sales and customer service. I was being screened for implantable contact lenses ICL. This is an elective procedure of $9,800 or $9,200 after a physicians referral discount. We briefly spoke out about financing options and I agreed to be preapproved to finance the procedure. There is also a distinctly cloudy issue as to whether or not a $9,200 Pacific Vision Institute credit card was preapproved or actually opened without my consent. Keep in mind this was for a procedure that had yet to be recommended by a physician or that I agreed to. She also misrepresented the interest rate of the procedure after a twoyear interest free period. The variable interest rate is 22.98%. Obviously this is to penalize the borrower for paying slowly but it\'s in excess of what was discussed. Incidentally I could have paid for the procedure in cash. I now have the burden of monitoring my credit reports for the next several weeks.Medical:Pros: NoneCons: LateMy appointment time was now over an hour. I was led to a waiting area then an office to wait for the doctor. After 20minutes of waiting I began to grow impatient. An assistant spotted my distress and tried to mollify me. I considered staying but overheard an irritated doctor saying he would be there in a few minutes. Collectively the doctor should have had 50minutes with my records and test results. After dealing with the saleswoman I decided to leave. Summary:Pros: Polite staff, Physicians seem competent after my own research Cons: Poorly organized, deceptive sales, disrespectful of patients timeMy candid opinion was that this was a medical business that relies on the unfortunate practice of overbooking and poorly communicating with the patient. This is made even more egregious by the high retail cost that each patient is paying out of pocket. Finally the deceptive practices of the saleswoman left a very bad taste in my mouth.My recommendation is that it isn\'t necessary to go here. There are many practitioners in the area for a variety of procedures excluding university based facilities. You should research the reputation of the physician, clinic, and price then determine if it\'s the right one for you. This was definitely not right for me.If you choose to go here state the amount of time you have and stick to it. Do not sign any or accept any financial terms until are ready to book a surgical appointment. Be an advocate for yourself and make sure that they are fully prepared. Finally trust your gut. Chances are that it\'s probably right.'),(3630,291,4,'I really appreciate their willingness to help :Thank you!!As I originally mentioned in the review,I do not regret or anything like that about getting LASIK at PVI.If someone who wants to get LASIK, I still recommend them.Don\'t be cheap about your life changing experience!Thank you, Dr. Faktrovich!I am your fan! :'),(3631,291,2,'PVI contacted me to point out that the saleswoman I met with during the consultation is actually a trained technician in addition to being a saleswoman.Nevertheless, I stand by my earlier comments that PVI\'s sales process is geared toward revenue maximization, rather than optimal patient disclosure. Patients should not have to make a $1,000 commitment before they are fully briefed by a highlytrained expert on the specific personal risks that they face with laser eye surgery.'),(3632,291,5,'OK, so it\'s officially been almost five months since my lasik operation and my eyes are great. I can see better than 2020 and no halos or any side effects at all. The entire staff at PVI is very helpful and friendly and Dr. Faktorivich is a pro. There\'s a reason why everyone goes here to get lasik done. Her success rate is very high and patients rarely have to come back for enhancements.'),(3633,291,5,'This place is just good memories. A tad pricey, yes, but awesome! But considering this is your eyes we\'re talking about, are you gonna skimp on it? I know I wouldn\'t I wouldn\'t ever skimp even a dime to make sure only the best is handling my eyes. And the best did  Dr. Faktorivich was in fact the the one who performed the procedure. So this place isn\'t one of those Dr on paper place. The doc is definitely IN.Now the rest of the staff:The staff was super friendly even before I promised to put a dime down.From the first second I walked in for a free consultation, I knew this place had customer satisfaction in mind. Graphs, education about the procedure, eyeexam, explaining to me what that graph of my eye meant micron by micron! Whew! That\'s awesome!Heck, and I walked away with huge bag of goodies without even promising to choose them to perform my LASIK. Well, by the end of the consultation I felt so good about this place, I just had to. I mean with a whole bag of vitamins, eye drops and stuff, how could I not? Financing:Financing options were nice and helpful, plus my patient coordinator really helped me out big time by knocking a few grand off list price because I didn\'t have insurance and I was paying out of pocket. Hell, she was awesome. She even remembered when I changed my hair style and we compared notes on it... after nearly a whole year! That\'s great personal attention to every patient.They said I\'d get 2020 for sure, I got 2015, and still true years later. And if it ever cease to be true, I know they\'ll follow up on their promise to touch on it up. I highly, highly recommend this place. I gave all my coupons away to friends who could use it, now they just need to cough up some dough to lose their glasses.

Night vision is pretty darn good and will get better. I know my results are particularly good.I have been wearing contacts and glasses for over 35 years.

The service is STELLAR!But seriously folks. I have researched and contemplated getting my eyes done for 10 years now. The advancements have just kept coming. IntraLASIK while I know it is not for everyone is amazing. No blades, all laser procedure. It was fast and completely painless. Just a very slight discomfort which was more mental than anything else on the second eye. Just don\'t think about what they are doing while you are in the chair. ; Look at the pretty lights! To be honest I would rather have this procedure done every 6 months than have my teeth cleaned.My advise to anyone is to spend an hour or two before the procedure and just relax. Meditate, get a massage or something and find your happy place. It will be so easy and go so fast. If you are messing with the eyes get the best. You get what you pay for and it was worth every single penny.Did I mention the free M&Ms and Jell Bellies? Thank You. You have changed my life.'),(3635,291,2,'SO HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO PAY?...THAT about sums it up about the sales job this women did after the consultation!

Needless to say, I had my work done elsewhere!Read Ahmet\'s review on the bottom! It confirms my suspicions!'),(3636,291,5,'A year ago my optometrist referred me to Dr. Faktorovich. I\'ve always wanted Lasik. I didn\'t even have the worst prescription nearsighted and astigmatism, but my contacts were never comfortable. I\'d been told I had a dirty tear layer and dry eyes, and that my eyes were always depositing proteins onto the lenses. She said that Dr. Faktorovich was very conservative when selecting appropriate candidates and was the only Lasik specialist that she refers her patients to.You should know that if you go in for a consultation, you will be meeting with a salesperson first. A very, very beautiful salesperson who might make you feel a little like a hobbit in comparison. A year ago I did not have the best experience with the sales consultation rather aggressive, and because it was my first exposure to elective surgery, I was sort of shocked that I was given the sales pitch before even finding out that I was a candidate. I was also not quite ready for the price. But I did find out that I was a candidate for Lasik.Fast forward one year. I started putting money into my FSA through work to get the tax savings. We bought a house and suddenly Lasik didn\'t seem so expensive compared to our mortgage. And my contacts were still driving me crazy. I went back to PVI. I met with another beautiful saleswoman who was way more mellow than the first one. Sales consult first does make sense. I mean, why waste the doctor\'s time evaluating everybody that walks in the door? Part of the consultation process is to make sure you\'re serious about it, because you will have to go through a number of pre and postop steps. And presumably to make sure you can pay for it or qualify for financing. Preop steps were pretty easy: lots of eye drops, no contacts for a week, and big fish oil pills to get your eyes hydrated. One thing nobody has mentioned is that if you start taking large quantities of fish oil all of a sudden, you might experience some ...uh, mild yet undesirable gastro effects. And you\'re supposed to keep up with the pills after the surgery as well. Just wanted to mention that.The surgery has already been described many times over, but I\'ll just recap that it\'s really not bad at all. Maybe five minutes of very very mild discomfort. They are lightning fast and you\'re on the happy pills anyway so just lie back and watch the light show. I do remember the sensation of having the flap swept back over my eye at the end with what looked like a tiny little silicone broom. Maybe it was the drugs! It didn\'t hurt, it was just odd. And of course if you\'ve ever seen Clockwork Orange, you can\'t help but think about Little Alex when they\'re putting the things on your eyes that hold your lids open. The entire team is quite friendly. Dr. Faktorovich greeted me on the day of surgery with a big, Hello lovely girl! which I liked. She\'s really sweet.After it was over my partner took me home and I took an Ambien from my own stash to pass out for the required four hours. I thought I would get Ambien from PVI but it doesn\'t seem like they are offering that anymore as part of the postop process.So, here I am. I had the surgery 8 days ago and am done with the weeklong regimen of drops, and the 4 days of eye shields. I had to pay out of pocket for the Zymar prescription drops which cost $100 at CVS. Ugh. But the most important part is that my vision is AWESOME. The evening of the surgery I watched TV without any correction for the first time since I was 12. I drove the following day without any problems. It\'s so unbelievable. I can only imagine how great it would feel for someone who had coke bottle lenses. It is so liberating to be free of contacts and the constant feeling of having something irritating my eyes. All of a sudden when I lie in bed now I notice tiny patches of paint on the ceiling that we missed when we painted our bedroom. I\'m like George Costanza spotting dimes on the floor from across the room.The best part is that I can TAKE NAPS NOW!! Whenever I would fall asleep with my lenses in, they would suction on to my eyes in this horrible way. So I\'d have to get up and take the lenses out and by then the magical prenap haze would have passed. NAPS, PEOPLE!Unfettered naps. If that\'s not worth $6500, I don\'t know what is.And like everyone else, I have the coupons if you would like one.'),(3637,291,1,'When they say consultation, they really mean really long obnoxious sales pitch. I can\'t believe that I let this establishment waste an hour and a half of my life.  I\'m sure the doctor does fantastic work but please spare me the bullshit and don\'t waste my time. Sorry pacific vision I will not be fooled or mesmerized by the glossy appearance that you put forth.... I can see right through it.'),(3638,291,4,'After researching a few other doctors, I decided Dr. Faktorovich was the best choice for me. Yes, she was the most expensive by a few thousand dollarsbut what made me choose her were the following:Dr. Faktorovich\'s reputation as a renowned expert in LASIK surgeryHer staff, facility and equipment are top notchService is outstandingConvenient office location to my work I\'m sure there are other surgeons who can do the job. What sealed the deal was her reputation and connections with doctors all over the world. I occasionally travel for work domestically and internationally. If I were to have an eye issue while traveling, I would just need to give a call to her office or her cell and she would connect me to the closest eye surgeon for help free of charge.  Dr. Lee who you will probably see often for the checkups is great too. He explains everything thoroughly and is also very friendly. Jenna who I talked to initially for payment plans and general procedure questions was also great to work with. My surgery went well with no sideeffects and I was seeing fine that evening. I wasn\'t at all nervous during the surgery. Dr. Faktorovich has a very calming voice and talked to me throughout the surgery. I was confident she would do a great job and she did.Why not 5 stars? Maybe I should of asked but I didn\'t get to meet Dr. Faktorovich till the day of the surgery. It would have been nice if she came in to meet with the patient for a few minutes in one of the presurgery appointments.'),(3639,291,4,'I had my lasik about 2 years ago and can still see 2020. The staff here is very professional and didn\'t feel pressured or rushed when asked about the procedure.  I was a bit uneasy about the procedure and did lots of research and interviewed other doctors who were less expensive.  When I went to other centers I always felt like I was just one of the 1000\'s that go thru their doors and not like it was an important procedure.At PVI they make sure you understand everything. They use the best equipment and Dr. Faktorovich is a highly regarded surgeon in this field. I know it costs 12k more than other places, but this is your eyes your dealing with. The only problem I had was the protective lens they put in my eye after the surgery slipped out that evening and I was in incredible pain.  I came in the next day and they put a new one back in. Was it their fault? I don\'t know, but maybe it was just a fluke that it fell out. It\'s great to not have to wear contacts anymore and I still have follow up appointments every 6 months or yearly. They also offer adjustments if your eyes ever go back to bad vision.'),(3640,291,5,'After so many years of dealing with contacts and glasses, I now have better than perfect vision!Everybody at Pacific Vision are great and welcoming. They explain the whole process clearly and after you\'ve had the surgery, they keep checking up on you to make sure everything is good. Not sure why I waited so long but it\'s WORTH the price as over the course of a lifetime, it\'s cents a day :'),(3641,291,2,'I went in for a consultation believing my LASIK surgery would be covered by my Health Savings Account after I maxed out the deductible. It\'s the reason I got the damn HSA in the first place.But since it\'s an elective procedure,my HSA funds can be used towards it, but its still out of pocket. After figuring this during the consultation, I realized I needed to rethink my plan to get LASIK until I\'d saved more.The operational staff were really nice and warm and the test showed I was a good candidate for LASIK. However, I did feel a lot of sales pressure to get the surgery from the reps even though I had indicated I had financial constraints. It was a little awkward at times, especially since it\'s the last thing you want to feel when considering surgery on your EYES.Anyways, this review is mainly for people in the consideration phase. Seems like everyone else posting rave reviews have made up their mind about getting the procedure.'),(3642,291,4,'Dr Friedman is professional, easygoing, and responds well to questions, even to calls after hours.  Cataracts were scary but they did a great job and made it much more comfortable.I also tried to go with CPMC who were so overloaded with patients it was like pulling teeth to get an appointment  any questions answered.  PVI is much better.'),(3643,291,5,'Review is from the hubby:I will start by saying that before going to PVI, I wore contacts for about 18 years and my contacts were in the range of 6.25 and 5.5...basically pretty blind without contacts. I am now at 3 weeks after the appointment and am testing at 2015.The day of the procedure, I had lived without my contacts for about 2 weeks per the recommendation of the Dr. Things were pretty miserable up to that point as I was not used to wearing glasses and was consistently getting headaches from my eyes adjusting. My appointment was at 8:30 AM and was there on the dot ready for the procedure. Given that it was my eyes, I had been very careful about doing all of the steps laid out in preparation drops, fish oil pills, etc. The initial procedure was very quick. Took less than 10 minutes for the machine to cut a flap in my eyes. After the first procedure, I was given a seat in the waiting area and told to rest up while the correction procedure was setup. They soon brought me into the other room where the Dr. put the eyelid holders on my eyes and numbing drops. This is probably the most uncomfortable portion of the process as all of a sudden you see a machine with a red light coming at your eyeballs. All you can do is just relax and realize that it will be over soon. They first did my right eye and began the adjustment of the lens. At some point and time, I recall feeling some tugging on my actual lens itself when they were moving the flap. It was over in less than 10 minutes and the other eye was very similar in experience and time. All in, you are looking at about 2 hours worth of procedure time and then you go home to rest. I took a nap and woke up around 1 PM to sight that was blurry but also somewhat clear. Hard to describe as it was the first time in my life that I could not read up close as my eyes were still adjusting to reading things close up. A bit disconcerting but I just put faith in the system and went back to sleep after taking the pills and putting in drops.They ask you to wear eye shields for a few days postop so that you don\'t rub your eyes in your sleep so don\'t be like me and freak out when you wake up with strange eye covers. By that first evening, I had pretty good vision, still some blurriness, but overall good vision.The next day was day after postop and I felt comfortable driving myself. I was tested as having 2015 vision and no major issues. Woo hoo, success!!On the drive home, I realized that my eyes were still adjusting as I was getting severe headaches from the daylight. This was an unusual side effect that I did not expect.The next week was spent putting in the medicated eye drops and the learning to deal with waking up with gunk in your eye from the nighttime lubrication drops. All in, a pain in the butt but being able to see was worth the effort. Throughout the week, vision continued to sharpen and although there were halos for night vision at first, they eventually disappeared. At the 2 week mark, I realized that I was having dryness issues with my eyes so started doing the Refresh Plus drops right before going to bed every night. This has helped tremendously and hopefully as my eyes heal and adjust, I can eventually wean myself off those.So this brings me back to today. Like I mentioned before 2015 vision and some slight eye dryness. Overall, I would rate my experience a 10 out of 10 as PVI did a great job of preparing me for the whole process as well as set expectations for what to expect after the surgery. There were no surprises along the way. The office staff was very professional and the Dr. brought my vision to perfect.If anyone wants a $300 referral coupon or to talk about the process, just send me a message!Thanks PVI!'),(3644,292,5,'I had a knee injury several months back and my previous orthopedic surgeon was very casual about it. He advised me to go to physical therapy.After going to a newly graduated PT, I wasn\'t getting better. Tried to stick with this person for 2 months until the end of 2014 but I was actually getting worsemuscle atrophy.So in the new year, when I got back from traveling, I searched for a new doc & found Dr. Louie.He was terrific! He really listened when I explained the circumstances of my fall, the lack of direction by the previous doctor and PT. He tested my leg and suggested I get an MRI.Got it done licketysplit at a nearby imaging facility. After reviewing the MRI, Dr. Louie said I definitely had no problems requiring an operation whew! but still needed PT to address the injury & atrophy. I got a list of PTs and did some due diligence in reading reviews on line !.Went to my super new PT and am now on the road to recovery.Followup visit was brief...I\'m on track & don\'t need to see the doc again.And my request for a copy of my MRI was fulfilled at no charge!Awesome service from front desk staff!Awesome bedside manner from the doc!Btw, Dr. Louie is capable of rebuilding limbs from serious accidents so even though my situation was probably extremely simple, he was incredibly nice to me. Check him out on Yelp!Thanks, Dr. Louie!'),(3645,292,5,'In the spring of 2014, after the surgeon for my previous left shoulder surgery happened to be on sabbatical, I sought out another reputable surgeon via Yelp and found Dr. Louie.Dr. Louie is very old school in that he took the time to explain both the condition and procedure on the initial visit. Also, he uses an actual medical book to do so! After he had examined the MRI results on my right shoulder, I was made fully aware of the contingencies involved and proceeded to make the surgical date ASAP.On the day of the surgery, Dr. Louie had a very down to earth bedside manner. I was completely informed at every step of the process by his team as the anestheisologist and nurse practitioner made their visits as well.Immediately after the surgery, I learned that I had four procedures done instead of three. In addition to the subacromial decompression, SLAP2 labrum repair, and mending of the full thickness tear of the supraspinatus, they had found that the bicep had partially torn away and used one of the anchors that tied down the labrum to perform the double duty of securing the bicep as well.He recommended that I begin physical therapy 10 days after surgery. It really made all the difference in getting back my near full range of motion!All of the follow up visits went well and he kept assuring me of his confidence of the quality of the surgery. On the final visit, he joked that he only wanted to see me again walking on the street and not in his office I\'ve since seen him for tennis elbow on my left arm.Dr. Louie and his entire team surgical staff and office administrators are all superb to work with.Yet, I also wish to never HAVE to see them again. I\'m sure they understand.'),(3646,292,5,'Dr. Louie is skilled, efficient, calm, reserved, yet friendly.My 70something year old knee joints were both replaced March 2014 without a hitch.

Running for shots was involuntaryno pain whatsoever.sooooo, Dr. Louie, thank you so much for your beautiful work and kind disposition.'),(3647,292,5,'This is not going to be a good review but it\'s unfair to give Dr. Louie\'s practice less than 5 stars for poor performance from his front office staff.I have a torn ACL from a skiing accident requiring surgery and booked an appointment with his office. The woman booking apointments made a point to tell me that Dr. Louie would not accept Blue Cross my insurance for the surgery and only accepted Blue Shield.I moved heaven and earth to change my insurance to Blue Shield at considerable expense so that Dr. Louie could do the surgery. Had to fill out hours of forms and take a special 1time hardship exemption to change the insurance provider after the enrollment year had started.After changing to Blue Shield, happily I called his office to schedule the surgery. The same woman said she made a mistake and that now, they only accepted Blue Cross the insurance I had to begin with and they would NOT accept Blue Shield.Her only suggested course of action after her mistake was to pay for the surgery in cash, she offered no other options. My insurance provider refuses to change it back again. Because of her mistake, I\'m stuck with subpar insurance for the rest of the year and it\'s difficult to book the surgery with another doctor because very few accept it. Unbelievable that one dimwit mistake in his office could cause so much hardship but that is exactly what has happened.'),(3648,292,5,'Dr. Louie and his office are highly professional. I went to him when a Marin doctor said my painful and swollen knee required immediate surgery had surgery already on this knee years ago. I felt he was incorrect and went to Dr Louie whom many neighbors recommended for a second opinion. He was fantastic, saw me quickly, drained the fluid in my knee , put me on anti inflammatory medication, ran blood tests, did all he could to diagnose the issue. He eventually determined I needed to see a rheumatologist and he was correct as I have inflammatory arthritis. I have to thank him though as he saved me unececessary surgery, was very thorough, and pointed me in the right direction. The office staff was lovely to work with as well.'),(3649,292,5,'I have never had knee issues, until last year, when I made a violent inward motion on my right knee. After that, it hurt and made a flubbing sound with flexion. I went to UCSF Dr. Senter. She told me this is normal. Just do leglifts for several months and it will be fine. I am a triathlete, so her insinuation that I was underdeveloped was way off  the only reason my muscles had atrophied was because it took 3 months to get in to see her. She even refused to perform an MRI!Fast forward 1 year, and a normal bending of the knee causes a furtherance of the yearold injury. I made an appointment with Dr. Louie and got in within only 3 weeks. Already much better than UCSF! He inspected it and said it seems very likely like a torn medial meniscus, both from the history, the symptoms, and palpating my pain. He ordered an MRI. Tests came back and confirmed his suspicion. Said it was textbook torn medial meniscus which cannot heal on its own due to poor vascularization and that surgery was recommended. Within 5 days, I was in the operating room, and an hour later, out of surgery.Now 10 days postop and feeling great. Have the followup appointment to get the stitches out have it checked on. Arrived 15 minutes early to appointment with Dr Louie, he gave me photos from surgery & MRI, plus surgery writeup, and was in to see me within 5 minutes. Great bedside manner, explained everything.

So I\'ve been to a lot of top rated orthopedics and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Dr Louie. I\'ve had ACL reconstructions in both knees 10 & 20 years ago respectively and have been hiking, skiing, golfing, etc. with only occasional soreness. Two weeks ago I woke up, took a couple of steps and one of my knee collapsed in pain. I was in pain when I walked and needed a cane. I went to one highly rated orthopedic MD who said that I had severe arthritis in both knees and one knee was boneonbone. He was very professional and had a good bedside style. He gave me a shot of cortisone to get me through an impending vacation and referred me to another surgeon for Total Knee Replacements TKR in both knees.I talked with an expert who sits through TKRs with many surgeons across multiple medical groups and he recommended a different surgeon, Dr. Kevin Louie. He said that Dr. Louie is the best, hands down. He said that Kevin is a great guy and an excellent surgeon.I had an appointment with Dr. Louie and he was great. He wanted to know about my quality of life with my knees prior to the recent flare up . . . before looking at the XRays. Since this was my first major flare up in 10 years, he said that there are a lot of options prior to deciding on surgery. I should be able to golf, hike and ski without creating further damage, and the important part is being able to maintain and active quality of life. I love it. A surgeon who recommended waiting on considering surgery! He has a great style and you can tell that he\'s looking out for your best interests. My source was right about Dr. Louie. He\'s the one for me going forward!'),(3652,292,5,'It brings me great joy to share this review. Dr. Kevin Louie is categorically the best orthopedic surgeon I can imagine. Some context: Dr Louie just performed yesterday an ACL reconstruction on my right knee. I injured it heliskiing, spoke to 5 different orthopedic surgeons 4 in the bay area, 1 at HSS in New York, and asked a ton of questions. I have also been to SteadmanHawkins in Vail with a girlfriend who had surgery on her ACL.3 things set him apart from the others I have met most of whom have walls littered with professional athlete photos, and sterling track records.1 Focus: in his consultation with me, he gave me his undivided attention, shared all the context around my choices, then went into wonderful detail on the actual procedure. Unlike others, he didnt say, this is what we will do, he instead said, here are the options, here are the tradeoffs, here\'s what I think makes sense. he gave me stories of athletes where it worked, where it didnt work. he gave context on why to wait 34 weeks for the swelling to come down pre surgery. He gave me literature to read, and projected a sense of an artisan practicing a craft. He was on time. And he spent the most time with me of all the docs I met.2 Character: often times these surgeons become a caricature of themselves, I suspect it\'s a reflection of the egos of the people they deal. Refreshingly, in Dr. Louie\'s case, he had what I would call a midwestern demeanor. He projected a total concern for the patient, and I could sense that radiated to all the others on his team  from Patty at the front desk to the assistants in the OR. There\'s talk of good bedside manner = bad doctor, that\'s bullshit in Kevin\'s case. He\'s just exceptional as a physician and creates a sense of excellence around him.3 Follow through and results!: I\'ve had 2 close friends who have had major knee reconstructive surgery with Dr Louie, and in each case they had been let down by a prior doctor. Dr Louie\'s approach with them didnt end at the operation  where he had done the seemingly impossible. He bonded with the patients, saw them through recovery, and tracked their progress down the road to full recovery. In my case he texted me last night, gave me an array of channels to reach him, and connected me with Presidio sports medicine for PT.I hope this review helps someone facing this tough, anxiety ridden decision find the best that there is. We are blessed to have Dr. Louie in the bay area!'),(3653,292,5,'I hurt my knee skiing and playing soccer and went to see Dr Louie.

Fortunately I didn\'t have to have any surgical procedure done, but I have no doubt that he would do an excellent job.

In conclusion he appeared to be a top Orthopedic in San Francisco, and I saw him to diagnose my MCL injury from a snowboarding incident.Kevin Louie deserves top marks all around. First I felt that he gave me a thorough diagnosis checking not only the acute injured area, but a complete analysis of my knee and range of motion. He described the result of my injury in complete detail, went through therapeutic exercises, and gave an honest assessment of recovery time as well as what I need to accomplish in order to recover successfully.I am accustomed to the doctor spending a hurried few minutes with me, while most of my time is spent in the waiting room or with nurses. It is for this reason I write a list of questions in preparation for the few sacred minutes I have with the doctor.

I have had 7 surgeries on the same leg thus I\'ve seen multiple doctors because of it; they have all been nice but they are nothing like Dr. Louie. In my conversations with Dr. Louie who is super easy to talk to, I learned that he was one of the first and few to properly train on the Ilizarov method, which is a crazy technique developed by a Russian surgeon following World War 2 after seeing many patients with bone deformities. This method involves bone cutting, placing many screws they call it pins but by how thick they are, let me just call them screws through the body and into the bone, and adjusting the corresponding struts on the external frame to literally shift the bone. This was my case, and it was not fun. I had the Taylor Spatial Frame on for 4 months and I could not have survived it without the sincere care of Dr. Louie and his wonderful staff. They really carried me through the tough times along with supporting family and friends. My leg deformity caused from a previous knee surgery crazy, right? is completely corrected and for the first time in maybe 20 years original ACLmeniscus injuries occurred early in high school, I am able to say that my knee does not hurt or bother me. Truly amazing.This technique is quite specialized and I\'m glad to have been referred to Dr. Louie for it I think he\'s 1 of 2 in Northern CA that can perform this. He could have charged a premium price. Instead, he accepts insurance so that outofpockets costs are minimal. I couldn\'t of have asked for a better situation.Dr. Louie is extremely talented and modest nice combination, and such a nice and patient person.

I went to Davies Rehab afterwards and have the same glowing remarks for them.Many people thought I was brave or a little crazy to have both knees done at once, I can\'t imagine doing it any other way. By the way, Dr. Louie did not push or encourage it, he didn\'t even push the surgery at all.

It frightens me that this person is responsible for my care. She then said she sent the referral, but upon a call to my surgeon, I found out she had not. NOTE: Dr. McCaw was on vacation at the time. I called Dr. McCaw\'s office again, only to find out she didn\'t send it because she didn\'t have my insurance information though didn\'t even call to tell me, simply didn\'t send it. And, it\'s something I had already given her 3 times, and was in the system. Pan to Tuesday, the day before my appt with the surgeon, and I have had to do my own follow up, hourly, as she continues to lose information, lie about it, and struggle with a simple referral to a Dr. in Dr. McCaw\'s network. She even admitted she didn\'t know how to fill out the referral, and I had to walk her thru it! I wonder what would happen if she had to do more than fill out a piece of paper.Long story short or not any longer I demand to speak to anyone else in the office, she says no. I tell her that I will hold until someone is available. She says noone will be and that she is alone, although I hear others in the background. She comes back to the phone and I can her someone coaching her on what to say to me. I ask to speak to them, she says no. Finally she gives me to someone, who calls my insurance which I already done and agreed that this should have been done, and all I need is a typed up letter sent to my Dr. and that she could have done that 3 days ago. The person helping me another Dr.\'s assistant does it herself, and it took 20 minutes.This person has a simple task while Dr. McCaw is out: answer phones, provide patients with high level information and assistance, and make appoints. Side note: the other person that I FINALLY spoke to not only handled this in 20 minutes after knowing nothing about my case, but also followed up with me to ensure I had everything I needed. I\'ll be switching to her Dr.'),(3674,293,1,'Dr. McCaw was a great GP, until I had an actual medical problem. Then, it seemed to all go out the window.I had recently switched insurance, but had a personal medical problem for whcih I was willing to pay out of pocket to obtain Dr. McCaw\'s consultation. I called and spoke with Wichelle to ask how much a visit would cost and she directed me to billing.  Billing had no idea what i was talking about when i asked how much does an appointment with Dr. McCaw cost. I was then directed back to Wichelle, who was unable to quote a price on a simple consultation. Eventually we got it situated and I was sent for lab testing with a follow up appointment scheduled.Upon arrival for testing about a week later, I found out that LabCorp had not received my lab specs from Dr. McCaws office. Their system was down and they had not received digital paperwork for the past few days. Not Wichelle\'s fault, admittedly, so I called and had them resend the worksheet via mail so I could go for testing a week or so later.Two weeks later, I arrive at LabCorp to get my work done. Casually, under the assumption i would receive a yes, I inquired as to the whether or not the labwork requested covered the ailment I was questioning. The lab tech responded no.I then called Wichelle, and asked how a comprehensive test could not cover the very reason I wanted to be tested. She apologized and had Dr. McCaw send over the proper test.30 minutes later, the requested work is received. It STILL did not cover the work I had requested. I then call Wichell back and, out of frustration, say the laymens terms for the ailment I wanted to be tested for since they still could not seem to get it right. At this point, the super hero lab tech got on the phone and talked to Wichelle until the proper work was requested. Mind you, this was a personal issue that I had to basically make public while on the phone with Wichelle all because of her ineptitude. Finally, I get the correct labwork done and schedule an appointment with Dr. McCaw for 2 weeks later on a Monday at 8:45 AM. Wichelle calls me the Friday before letting me know that the appointment has been changed to 8:15 AM. Naturally, because their time is much more valuable than mine I will obviously change my schedule AND pay for their services, despite the embarrasing situation they had put me in.I wrote an email to Dr. McCaw regarding the previous issues, to which I never received a response.Monday arrives and I show up 7 minutes late for my appointment. The receptionist says I\'m late and he and Wichelle proceed to talk about me in Tagalog apparently thinking I have know idea what they\'re saying. Poor choice. I won\'t elaborate on what she said because my point of how rude she is has pretty much already made.After having insulted me to her coworker, I go back and talk to Wichelle who explains I have to reschedule. But of course. I again, resend my email to Dr. McCaw with an update of the current events and receive no response.The lack of response is why I hold Dr. McCaw personally responsible. Other complaints have been made about her MA and it appears nothing has been done. And when I reach out to her, twice, with a complaint and no response, the onus is now on her.Perhaps this publically listing the events will make her respond.'),(3675,293,5,'I have a permanent, degenerative disease which prevents me from functioning at all on a daily basis without medication.

I have not been able to get out of bed in the morning for all the pain, since the doctor cut off my meds.

I had some recent major life events loss of a parent and there was a lot on my plate so I wrote it off for a couple weeks. I had been lifting a lot of boxes and such and figured I injured an abdominal muscle. I really didn\'t have any other symptoms that I noticed.They squeezed me in, and Dr. McCaw who I had never met immediately saw what I couldn\'t.

My wife had called Dr. McCaw with a question about the medication prescribed which did not appear to be working. She told her to take it for another week already had been taking for 1 week with no positive results. This is because it was the wrong medication for the wrong condition.On top of that, during a referral, Dr. McCaw assured my wife this would be covered under insurance. We indeed were billed for the referral service which we were assured was covered. While I would not expect a doctor to know the ins and outs of insurance policies, I would expect them to tell their patient that they do not if something is covered rather than misinform them.

Corey always answers the phone, if she can\'t she calls you right back with information in hand. She is VERY knowledgeable and solves the problem, resolves an issue, forwards a referral on that very phone call. It\'s done. As an assistant this gal is worth her weight in gold!

This exam lasted for 5 minutes, during which the doctor performed basic things like blood pressure testing and listening to my lungs. She then asked me some questions about my general health, checked some items on my chart and a blood test form and then was out of the room. Later, after taking the blood test, which had to be separately scheduled and thus required a second trip, it took almost 2 months to reach Dr. McCaw to receive her interpretation of my blood test results. At one point, her assistant told me that the easiest way to reach the Dr. was to schedule an appointment. I thought that was outrageous given that an appointment would generate a new service bill!Well, Dr. McCaw and I finally spoke via telephone about my test results and she gave me generic advice about vitamin and mineral supplements and then suggested that I come see her again in six months. Honestly, I felt like instead of being in the business of medical care, she was in the business of generating office visits and thus fees!Outside of my complaints about her brief service, unavailability for test interpretation and weak interpretation once tracked down, I\'m now battling with her over a service bill for a blood test that she ordered but my health insurance company doesn\'t cover as part of a routine annual exam. I\'ve spent nearly 8 months trying to resolve this matter and it remains outstanding. Dr. McCaw, during the 5 minute annual exam that she performed, ordered a test to verify something that I told her about my medical history. I did not ask her to verify this nor did she ask me if I wanted the test run. And I told her that this condition regularly shows up in my blood tests and that I was taking mineral supplements to support it. I expressed no concern about the matter and only shared it with her in order to give her my complete medical history and as a precaution for future reference. Now, I\'m faced with a service bill and possible collections actions, as I have refused to pay the service bill. So I fully intend to pursue every action available to require that Dr. McCaw becomes responsible for her mistake of ordering the test without bothering to ask me if I wanted it, ie she should have this item removed from my service bill OR pay it herself!!

When relocating back to the Bay Area, I started the process of asking friends and checking reviews in the hopes to find an all in one, i.e. doctor and expert on the latest products and procedures. After trying a friends derm, and one of the med spa\'s on the corner, I finally decided it was more important to get a doctor have dozens of moles, fair skin that spent the 80\'s in tanning beds and beaches covered in baby oil... As a happy, long time user of the UCSF system, I pulled up their list of dermatologists close to my home. What got me in the door, from her online profile, was her extensive education, training, and overall involvement with her industry. What has kept me coming back as a loyal, referring, patient, is not only has she helped me with the doctor part in managing my dozens of unique moles and other middle aged medical needs, is she has gone above and beyond in giving me a long term approach to improving my skin and the results prove it. I started with IPL sessions complimented with retinoids and good all around over the counter products. I know next year or two I will probably start Fraxel ahhh, the neck!! and expand use of BotoxDysport into my forehead. She\'s also answered my never ending, unrelatedtocurrentofficevisit questions and given me practical approaches e.g. Hair thinning to solve my concerns. I now have my husband in his mid 40\'s going to her for mole checks and starting to get some of his sun spots removed  he\'s a big fan and not easy to please!I know this is long, but one last update which prompted me to post this Yelp: I woke up one morning with an inflamed mole on the side of my neck. After two days of pain and getting paranoid about why a mole would inflame overnight, I walked into her office asking if I could just sit and wait as long as it took for a cancellation. Understanding how nervous I was, her receptionist explained the situation to Dr Dolev and I was fit in between patients. No questioning, no trying to have me wait a day or two, no extra charges. She looked at it, assured me it wasn\'t anything to be concerned as it was a blood clotfollicle irritation and just needed to be removed. Path results confirmed her diagnosis, all was well, just an old tired mole, lolIn short: She is the allinone skin ninja. She rocks as a dermatologist, has improved my appearance and therefore confidence with the latest technologies and products, and never once was I surprised by things like add on costs or getting products pushed on me. She\'s even saved me money by bundling extra laser session costs retroactively when I decide to go back for just one more.

I went to her for a couple reasons, I had a rash developing near my underarm area but I mainly went to see her for facial acne. I\'m 33 years old and had some recent breakouts and I always had oily skin. From the first appointment until the last time I saw her I always felt rushed and she never took the time to look at my skin carefully. During that first appointment she handed me a tube of Tretinoin Cream Retinoid and told me to use every other night then eventually every night. If you have oily skin you DO NOT want to use the Retinoid cream instead you want to use the Gel. The difference is night and day. This cream made my skin even oiler and I had ongoing bad breakouts. You will have breakouts when using a retinoid but if your skin is getting worse after a few months STOP using it and revaluate. I should have stopped using it and demanded the gel but I was following Dr. Dolev\'s recommendations. I ended up having many hyperpigmentations red acne marks on my face that pushed me to getting an IPL treatment from Dr. Dolev. Unfortunately this treatment gave me 2nd degree burns at 4 locations of my face. One of the worst experiences of my life! Dr. Dolev took no responsibility for this and just said it was my skins reaction to the treatment. She seemed offended when I asked for a refund and eventually sent me a check with a letter saying she would not see me anymore. I have since seen other dermatologists through One Medical Group and I\'ve had a great experience. Whoever you see for your skin make sure they take the time to look at your skin carefully before they recommend something.Recap and some additional comments;* DO NOT buy a retinoid from Dr. Dolev. You can find a Dermatologist that will reach out to your insurance company for coverage and just pay the copay. I have BCBS and I pay an $8 copay per tube instead of $50.  * If you have oily skin USE the Retinoid Gel instead of the cream. Very important!* DO NOT get an IPL treatment from Dr. Dolev. See above * DO NOT buy any products from Dr. Dolev. Buy online or try cheaper products that are just as good. Paula\'s Choice is a good website to educate yourself on your skin and it also gives product reviews. * DO NOT pay Dr. Dolev for other in office treatments without checking with your insurance company first. I had some cortisone shots I paid $150 for only to find out later that my insurance covered the full cost.* Good luck!'),(3710,294,1,'I think it\'s interesting that I received a rude phone call today from this office challenging my review.

My sister even asked What are you doing to your skin? I actually look forward to our appointments and have settled into a skincare routine that is easy to maintain and, as stated, shows results.  BTW, her office staff is affably efficient and the office itself is tastefully appointed with interesting artwork  all of which makes the whole experience pleasurable.'),(3715,294,5,'I\'ve been seeing Dr. Dolev for nearly a year, and I\'ve found her to be compassionate and highly effective. I missed my first appointment because I just completely forgot. Days later I broke out in a rash related to a vitamin I was taking, and I called her office. Despite the fact that I had been a no show, Dr. Dolev got me in immediately. I see that some former patients have complained about how quickly she reviews your skin during the annual check up. I asked her once why she didn\'t need to analyze my skin under a special light, and she told me that she can tell when there\'s a problem and that it\'s only when there\'s a problem that she needs to take a closer look. Dr. Dolev got her medical license from Yale in the highly competitive dermatology field. She\'s good enough that she doesn\'t need the bells and whistles, and she won\'t recommend a costly procedure if she doesn\'t think it will help. When I\'ve had questions about a treatment, she\'s always listened and has been willing to work out alternatives. You\'re in good hands with Dr. Dolev.'),(3716,294,5,'Dr. Dolev is a wonderful physician. She has a caring and attentive bedside manner and I would recommend her to anyone looking for a topnotch Dermatologist.'),(3717,294,5,'When I look for a Dr. I want someone well educated, experienced, calm, and with a good bedside manner. Dr. Dolev checks all of these boxes. I have been seeing her for years now and she is fullservice  from doing mole checks to suggesting preventative aging products. Her schooling is from top notch elite institutions, but her approach is very downtoearth. I never feels like she is trying to sell me on something  in fact she sometimes discourages me from expensive techniques that she doesn\'t feel I need. If you are looking for someone who will give you honest, helpful feedback on how to help your skin looks its best, she is your woman. No sales pitch, nothing pushy  just genuine, wellinformed guidance. I highly recommend her.'),(3718,294,5,'This is an overdue review for Dr. Dolev. I have been to many dermatologist in the bay area and Dr. Dolev is hands down the best. She takes her time ALWAYS to explain diagnosis and any procedure...And, with great bedside manner. I liked her so much I had my picky teenage daughter see her for her acne and my daughter loved her. In this age of medical spa at every corner, it is refreshing to go to an actual doctor who is nice, knows what to do and do it right.'),(3719,294,1,'This is the very WORST EXPERIENCE I\'ve ever had in a doctor\'s office. Totally deceitful billing practices and a complete lack of customer service.The Doctor & VisitI went to see Dr. Dolev in late January, after confirming she was covered by my insurance. The visit was pretty mediocre and took approximately 15 minutes in total. I had a skin rash and wondered if it was allergyrelated and Dr. Dolev was somewhat dismissive of my observations. At the end she prescribed hydrocortisone and tried to convince me to buy a hypoallergenic cleanser and moisturizer from her office, each of which ran $50. I decided not to go back to her because I just felt like her practice had no interest in considering natural remedies or, more basically, trying to understand what was causing the problem in the first place. Plus I didn\'t want to pay money just to get a recommendation for hydrocortisone, which hadn\'t worked anyway. Maybe she just specializes in cosmetic procedures? Unauthorized Charges 5 months LaterFive months later, I see almost $300 in charges from her office appear on my credit card. Having never received a bill, I try to call the office to see what these charges are for. I am pretty civil, because I want to see if we can come to a resolution. The receptionist is completely dismissive, refuses to talk to me, and says that the billing person isn\'t in and that the billing person will call me when she gets a chance. I wait for days and never get any call back. I call again and the receptionist sounds hostile. I ask this time to talk to Dr. Dolev directly and she says that Dr. Dolev doesn\'t deal with patients. I wonder if Dolev ever deals with the reputation of her practice...Again the receptionist says she will have the billing person call. Now it\'s been over a week and I still have never received a call. I even tell the receptionist that I am considering reviewing the practice, as no one has taken the time to ever actually call me back, and she just reiterates that someone will call. A week goes by. Still nothing.I finally get a receipt for my credit card payment in the mail. One of the charges doesn\'t even have a description beside it so I can\'t resubmit it to the insurance company. The main charge is a $250 charge just for coming in as a new patient. It isn\'t that I don\'t want to see the doctor get paid whatever she is due, I just a. find it deceitful to charge patients without providing a bill,b. find the lack of customer service and open hostility to be abhorrentc. and find this practice to be completely not interested in the well being of their patients.'),(3720,294,5,'Dr. Dolov is really terrific. I have all the risk factors for skin cancer including several occurrences. First and foremost on my list is to have a dermatologist who is an excellent clinician, a strong communicator and is able to stay informed on current research. That is Dr. Dolov! She is warm in her manner, highly competent and very conscientious. Upon moving to SF, I had the misfortune of first landing in the care of a doctor who used questionable medical practices and left me with an unnecessary and unattractive scar and the incision site took three month to heal!. I switched to Dr. Dolov and felt immediately reassured that she would provide me with excellent medical care. Additionally, she has wonderful office staff who are willing to answer all my questions and to help me find the various products that I need.

I highly recommend Dr. Dolov and her great staff.'),(3721,294,5,'Dr. Dolev is the best dermatologist I\'ve ever had. She\'s friendly, personable, professional and really listens to her patients. No skin concern is too small for her. She\'s great with cosmetic laser treatments, too. Plus she\'s a mom and feels like a real person. Not someone who\'s going to try to upsell you on extra procedures you don\'t need. She\'s the only Dr. in her office so you get a lot of personal attention. You\'ll always get to see her every time. And the office is good about responding to email.'),(3722,294,5,'Dr. Dolev is a pretty impressive dermatologist. Her resume boasts degrees, internships, residencies and fellowships at all the best universities. She practices a nice mix of cosmetic and traditional dermatology. She\'s intelligent, articulate and wellinformed, she has a nice clinical manner and a lovely, efficient office, and her treatment skills are excellent. And she\'s good with kids, too! I brought in my 6year old son, who was charmed although scared to have a wart removed. I found Dr. Dolev after my trusted dermatologist of 27 years retired. She is now my NEW trusted dermatologist for the next 27 years, at least! I will definitely return to her office for future needs.'),(3723,294,5,'Dr Dolev saved my life on Tuesday.

I left an anguished voicemail describing my situation and kept my fingers crossed for a call back. I got it but the Receptionist told me that she was technically off this week but was in seeing patients for the next hour  how quickly could I make it. I scooped up my 3 year old and drove over to CPMC and screeched into the parking lot. When I arrived I found out that she had waited for me to arrive and did all my new patient paperwork right there and then. She confirmed the diagnosis and upped my meds and today I\'m starting to feel a tad better but boy oh boy the discomfort is unlike anything I\'ve ever experienced.

You can be sure I will be back and will make sure to tell everyone I know about my really great experience.'),(3724,295,5,'I have been going to IHH to see Dr. Palinasamy for two years. He is an incredible physician with a rare combination of a firm foundation in Western medicine with advanced clinical knowledge of effective approaches to holistic health.  I have a complex health situation that requires patience and advanced knowledge that the majority of clinicians in the US simply are not aware of extreme mold sensitivities and thyroid challenges.   While Dr. P is a Harvard trained physician, he is very humble and listens to me as a patient and works with me to create an effective treatment plan.  I am very grateful to have access to a physician of this caliber.The front desk staff are also very lovely and accommodating; I always look forward to seeing them when I come in for a visit a.

I also go see Laurence McKee for abyangha massage and I adore her, for both personality and quality of massage. Also my boyfriend was snoring and Laurence did this treatment on him, and he has not snored since!!! He is also seeing Dr. Akil. We are both taking herbs prescribed by him and are making progress towards thriving. Honestly I have been reluctant to write a review because I don\'t want other people to steal all my appointment times. : . So don\'t you go and do that. Unless you really really need to. Dr. Akil is the perfect blend of alternative and holistic combined with traditional M.D. and it doesn\'t hurt that he went to Harvard!! He makes me feel less crazy so that is definitely a plus. I am going to wait another little while before I get a blood test for definitive results, but as far as I can tell, I feel a lot better already.

She pulled the same nonsense on one of my friends going through a serious illness and that friend also decided to leave Dr. Roberts\' practice.No one wants to go to a place where you pay in full and then, due to systems errors or user errors, receive unfounded bills that they can neither explain nor correct. Today, after having told me two months ago that she corrected my spa bill, I was told that she actually had not corrected the bill , but had increased my bill because she went through Laurence\'s the practitioner\'s notes and determined that I should been billed a higher rate even though I paid in full, and always pay in full before I leave. I feel she did this to because she was upset when I complained about her service. She never bothered to call me to follow up and let me know that she had decided, on her own, to increase the bill. This is not a place of peace or healing when dealing with this person and this issue, it is a place of serious disfunction in my view and if she tells you something has been corrected, be prepared to have to deal with it THREE more months until you just throw up your hands and pay a bill that isn\'t even correct; I have done that more than once. Heads up to other clients, I have been told that the systems software does not easily accommodate the seasonal rates offered in the spa, so be mindful of your bills. Frankly, I \'ve been going through this for years, but I liked the practitioners so much, I kept trying to overlook it. This time, however, the mistreatment and miscommunication was shocking and disgusting. When you mess up the same thing repeatedly, I hope you are in the business of working with zen priests, because the rest of us do not have that kind of patience.I will miss Laurence, Dr. Roberts and Pauline...they were great.'),(3727,295,5,'IHH is THE place for healing!

Plus, my skin really did look toned and firmer, and my brown spots were vanishing. It has definitely been worth my commitment. And kind of exciting. I had feared I had waited to long for such a change in my complexion.So, if you are looking for someone who is an honest resource and who really pays attention to the changes in your skin, I am happy to refer Laurence. She examines me fresh each visit and she tracks my issues. She recommended the right treatment for me.

She never mentioned any free or inexpensive classes. The conversation reeked of medical elitism. It\'s not that my insurance won\'t pay, they just won\'t pay enough. Your typical San Francisco non profit. Nice tax exempt status, none of the service. If I was going to spend the money for an hour massage, I would go to Kabuki where they have unlimited bathing with a massage and no one pushing supplements down your throat.

I\'m not one for chitchat during a massage, and Pauline picked up on that, as she set me up with lightning quick transport to Spaceville. She stocked the ship well, with fine Swedish tools for working tight bands of muscles, fancy Shiatsu buttons for releasing key trigger points, & Craniosacral slides to slip down for serenity and lasting body changes. The ride was rocky at times, with therapeutic turbulence deep tissue goodness, mixed with brief moments of placid stillness light, strategic holds.

Not needed.Only blips on the radar were the cold room, and the sometimes distracting street traffic sounds outside.I finally took advantage of one of the perks of being a CPMC employee: discounts at the Health & Wellness center. Woot! I do not know where else I can get an 80 minute massage for $79. Nonemployee rates are competitively priced too: $115 for 80 minutes, $85 for 50 minutes.

Laurence is possibly one of the sweetest, most intelligent women I\'ve met and I highly recommend her for any type of bodywork that she offers. I was basking in a 1.5 hr. relaxing specialty massage when phones started ringing, highheels were clanking everywhere, voices were heard rather audibly... I\'m from NY and pretty used to the unpreventable street noise, but the noise within the Health and Healing wing was definitely avoidable. All the recptionist women had to do was remove their heels before coming in and out of the foyer  which technically should separate the massage rooms from the lobby. I\'ve seen this done in many places  it\'s just a sign of respect. My masseuse even encouraged me to say something as she said that it\'s been a chronic problem and disrupts her clients. In a very sweet and respectful manner, I let the women at the front desk know. They just started at me blankly and said uhhuh in a sort of fake b.s. tone that made me feel like I was transported back to the bitchy clickland of middleschool. So fake. Alas I am so glad that CPMC offers this sort of holistic integration  but it needs some finetuning. Ultimately:5 stars for their therapeutic offerings, and brilliant practicioners4 stars for their amazing selection of herbs, botanicals, nutritional formulas, and other useful goods at their little outpost. 3 stars for location parking is awful and SO expensive.

I told her my shoulders were very tense but she didn\'t seem to focus on them more than a normal massage. She has nice strong hands and overall I enjoyed the massage but she spent several minutes with her hands in static positions i.e. not massaging and although I could tell this this was her style it really irritated me. So I\'m only going to give her 3 stars. Mindy Zimmerman was also good but her hands were not strong enough for me. Kelly Dacey is the one for me.  She has really strong hands and is very pleasant. The receptionists are all very nice and the place doesn\'t have your typical snooty spa like atmosphere. Their prices are pretty reasonable $70 for a one hour massage and because they are affiliated with CPMC they do not allow tipping!

My final pair of contact lenses tore immediately after putting them in, and I did not have a pair of backup glasses, so rather than having a 30day buffer I needed an appointment as soon as possible, but I still was concerned that I received quality care.I crossreferenced my employerprovided insurance network with reviews on Yelp and my own judgement to try to find an eye doctor. Dr. Bert\'s office has some glowing reviews but also a few very negative ones, so as hinted above I had initially ruled out this office. However, after trying a few other offices and being unable to find an appointment earlier than the middle of March unacceptably long in my situation, I scheduled an appointment at Dr. Bert\'s despite some reluctance.Looking back, I can\'t believe I was so skeptical.The process of scheduling the appointment was very easy. I called and the receptionist was very friendly, and looked up my insurance information while on the phone to make sure I would be covered.My ONLY nit about the entire experience was that the lady on the phone forgot that I requested both an eye exam and a contact lens fitting  she scheduled just the eye exam at first, and I only caught the error when she read everything back to me to confirm. This is a forgivable and very human mistake.I arrived 25 minutes early as requested so I could fill out new patient forms. The front desk staff were all incredibly friendly, very chatty, and were clearly quite cheerful and loved their job. My appointment was perfectly on time.Dustin, the optometrist, was also very friendly and helpful. I did not have my previous eye records available, and also felt that, despite having worn the same contacts for 8 years, my previous lenses of choice either no longer fit as well or were less well tolerated by my eyes.

Dustin was very patient in the conversation that led to these revelations despite that I got the impression my situation was unusual.I saw Dr. Benjamin Bert for the ophthalmologist\'s part of the appointment. He too was quite friendly notice the trend here. I always ask lots of questions when I see doctors, and he was patient and happy to answer all of them. He cracked a couple of jokes and made light conversation but also was very efficient and professional. Based on the shape of my eye he suggested a different brand of contact lenses from those I\'d been wearing for the past 8 years, and thus far he has been spoton as the trial pair immediately felt much more comfortable than I was used to and continues to feel this way.Overall an incredibly positive experience and I will be recommending this office to anyone I know who is looking for an eye doctor in this area.'),(3774,296,5,'Outstanding experience here as a new patient..

Dr. Bert was abrupt, condescending, and quite judgmental when examining my vision. Due my age and occupation, he assumed that my vision was worsening because of excessive computer use. He then went on a tirade about how this generation mine was ruining their eyes and that no medical intervention would be able to help them. When I started to do the reading test, I had trouble seeing the smallest letters. As I struggled, I kept telling Dr. Bert that I couldn\'t clearly see them. But instead of focusing on correcting my vision, he started up again, berating me like a child about how computers were ruining my eyes. I was stunned.I decided to get a second opinion from another qualified UCSF ophthalmologist who confirmed that Dr. Bert was a bit different and had strong opinions. He also confirmed that my family history of poor vision and natural aging were actually stronger factors in my changing vision, something that Dr. Bert was probably aware of but chose to ignore during my examination. I am concluding that he was more interested in expressing his viewpoints and biases rather than offering an objective, professional assessment.Another reviewer commented that Dr. Bert is like a jolly ol\' grandpa.

At Dr. Bert\'s, I had to pay an additional $175 just for the contacts exam. That is absurd. On top of that, I feel that he is advertising for acuvue oasys or gets some benefit for recommending them. I was doing excellent with my coppervision brand, but he INSISTED on switching me to acuvue. However, Acuvue was simply not right for meit was uncomfortable and my makeup always seem to get on them. After switching between three different contacts and numerous visits back to the office, he finally switched me back to coppervision, but not until he told me that I must be using the wrong make up.

They were so thorough and helpful...I am completely impressed! Rarely do I encounter a doctor who is not rushed and pushing you through the system. The office had an upbeat vibe and is in a convenient location. More impressive, the staff saw the employer on my health insurance and immediately knew that my vision coverage was separate. They received quick authorization from my provider and then walked me through every charge. They helped me make the decision to use my insurance towards new frames and lenses since this would be the better deal with my insurance company. Seriously, how often do you look forward to your next visit with a doctor? I do with Dr. Bert!'),(3798,296,5,'I have been a patient of Dr Bert for 8 years and really value him and his team. Yes, he is pricier and yes, he does charge for contact lens fitting. But, people, this is a MD, as in Medical Doctor, not an optician and not an optometrist. He will only recommend products that will work for you and your eye health. Dustin is the in house optician and has great recommendations for frames and also really understands the ins and outs of insurance to make sure you\'re maximizing your coverage. They will also take the time to listen and follow up to make sure your new lenses or glasses are working right for you.'),(3799,296,4,'Dr. Bert is a very good doctor, and I agree with those reviews that call him a very typical New Yorker. He is a no nonsense kinda guy, which is a good thing when you\'re dealing with a doctor. This makes him come off as somewhat abrasive, but again, I don\'t really mind that in a doctor. I went to him with an an itchy red eye and he prescribed eye drops and pills, but was very adamant that I needed to do hot compresses 4 times a day. Some quotes from my first appointment:I can give you these pills and drops, but if you don\'t do the compresses, they WON\'T WORK!! There will be nothing I can do for you if you don\'t do the compresses!I don\'t get mad at patients on the first visit; I get mad at them on the second.He scared the bejesus out of me, which was actually a good thing. I followed his advice and did the 4 compresses a day religiously, which was actually a very good thing that helped heal my eye in the long run. The tough love isn\'t for everyone, but I like his style. Well done Bert.'),(3800,296,5,'Just got back from my best Opthamologist appointment ever because of Dr. Bert and his staff! I immediately felt like family with a little tough love but lots of care and education. Dustin helped me pick out my trendy glasses that fit my style and I\'m super stoked with my choice!

My eye hemorrhaged 2 hours before a long planned international trip. I had no choice but to see Dr. Bert as he was a referral from my ophthalmologist who was on vacation. My doctor\'s office scrambled to get me in. Very bad timing  lunch hour closure at both doctor\'s offices. Dr. Bert knew I had ONE hour to make it to the airport TSA rules or decide to cancel the trip. This was explained to his office by my doctor\'s office requesting an emergency visit.All I needed to know is if my eye needed more medical tests in order to cancel my trip and lose a bunch of money or if I was able to go as planned. During the 2 MINUTE examination, he dilated my eyes and told me he would probably have to dilate them again  total wait time 40 minutes for two dilations. He knew I wouldn\'t make it to the airport on time from SF to SFO with 40 minutes of dilation. As he walked out of the examination room to see another patient, he asked me who primary care physician PCP was, as it turned out my PCP was a personal friend of his. I asked if he needed to speak to my PCP now as time was short and he said yes. When I got my primary care on the phone, Dr. Bert refused to take the call.It was obvious that Dr. Bert did not care one bit about my eye or travel plans. He only succeeded in making the event and my travel to the airport highly stressful. IF Dr. Bert were truly a caring, thoughtful doctor he would have suggested a plan, next steps or recommend the trip be canceled. Note: a doctor\'s note will help with the airlines rebookingInstead he went to the next patient. After a few minutes of helplessness, I left his office and went on vacation with dilated eyes. I told his assistant to have Dr. Bert call me if he thought I would lose my vision or eye.  Did he call me on my cell phone to say one something about my eye? Did he write a letter? No and no. But he DID send a bill for his 2 minutes of expert time. While on the trip a nurse who worked for a corneal surgeon, looked at my eye and said I would be fine. Indeed I am. Certainly not with the help of Dr. Bert. If you need a doctor who is all about him, no compassion or care about you, Dr. Bert, in my opinion, is your guy. If you need compassion, thoughtful explanations, followup or generally good patient care regarding your vision or an eye, you might want to think twice. There was a reason I never went back to him years ago after my PCP referred him. This was an emergency situation handled poorly. FYI this visit was just after Dr. Bert returned from lunch. There was one other patient in the waiting room.'),(3802,296,5,'He is the best doctor I\'ve seen in my life. Very professional, caring, thoughful!

He is the BEST!'),(3803,296,2,'Dr. Bert is a good enough doctor. I can\'t stand his staff.  They are cold and very unfriendly Just like what the other posters said.

He recommended physiotherapy and acupuncture which was working really well  little slow recovering but going the right direction. Statistically, physiotherapy works 50% of the time for a bulging disc no surgery needed. Unfortunately, physio did not work for me, and about three months into the physiotherapy, I herniated my L4L5 disc while bending down. Over the next couple of weeks my back got worse so I went back to Ray. He evaluated my new symptoms and had me schedule an MRI ASAP. With MRI in hand, Ray saw me next day. Upon review of the MRI Ray opened his schedule for the following day and I went in for surgery.The procedure took about a 12 day, from admittance to discharge. I emailed Ray every day over the next week or so and he was extremely responsive. It been 6 weeks since my surgery and I\'m doing absolutely fantastic. I returned to work within three weeks, and am walking 3 miles a day. If you want an orthopedic surgeon that delivers results, then Ray Oshtory is the guy.If you\'re still unsure, go meet him and ask about industry success statistics for surgery and how his stats compare. As a guy that\'s spent 30+ years in engineering, I\'m all about the results. I have not been disappointed, and I doubt you will be either!I\'m now seeing Ray for some other spine related stuff, and he\'s right on it...I have no complaints!'),(3805,297,5,'Over the years Dr. Oshtory has given me nothing but the best advice. As I am approaching 40 and my body has begun to exhibit random back pain here and there, Ray continues to give advice that gets to the root cause of the pain exercise, and muscle building...he has never gone for the quick fix pain meds, etc. I understand some patients want the easiest answer to their problems, but sometimes the path of least resistance leads to the worst possible outcome. He is as honest as they come and has the most integrity of any doctor I\'ve ever visited. You may not like what he has to say, but he is always going to give you the best advice, based solely on the scientific evidence. Many doctors will recommend surgery because that\'s where they make the most money...Ray is the opposite. He only recommends surgery when it\'s absolutely necessary. Surgery is a big deal and should be treated as such. He also may not be the warmest or the fuzziest doctor in the world, but he is by far one of the smartest, most dedicated doctors I\'ve come across. I don\'t go to doctors to become their friends, I go to doctors to get the best advice possible. Highly recommended.'),(3806,297,5,'No one WANTS to get back surgery... I feel confident stating that factually. But if you\'ve exhausted every other option, you\'d better go see Dr. Oshtory.After feeling a sensation similar to being tasered in my lower back and upper leg during heavy weightlifting, I woke up the next day to find that I had shooting pains all the way down my left leg and numbness in my toes. Being an avid weightlifter and athlete, I have had my share of injuries, but I knew this was really bad. Life changingly so. The MRI revealed I had a severe lumbar disc herniation and I was told by a spine specialist that I had four options.The first was physical therapy, which I started immediately. The therapy centered around using your legs and hips to support balance and weight, rather than your lower back. Learning to change my habits was helpful, but the shooting pain down my leg was still unbearable. The second option was to receive antiinflammatory cortisone shots directly into my back around the herniated disc to try and relieve the pressure on my nerve. While the shots helped temporarily, it was not a longterm solution. The third option was to remain patient while continuing options 1 and 2 and wait until my body slowly adapts to the herniation, taking up to 14 months. I couldn\'t take the pain another month let alone 14.The fourth option was surgery. I began to research back surgeons by talking to other surgeons I knew in the greater San Francisco Bay Area, and every road led back to Oshtory. It is one thing to be recommended by a patient or someone you know, but an entirely different thing to be sent to a surgeon that other surgeons look up to. I scheduled an appointment which was without hassle, by the way in order to get a consult. After seeing my MRI, he was not hasty into telling me surgery was the only option, and proceeded to lay out exactly what my choices were.I continued physical therapy, but my reluctance to have surgery began to wear off as my gains in therapy did not include less pain. I had my surgery on July 14th, and I woke up in postoperations with zero pain. Two weeks later, I am back to my everyday activities with no pain.Again, deciding to have back surgery is not a decision anyone wants to contemplate, but if you decide to do it, Dr. Oshtory is your guy. Not every type of back pain is surgically curable, but if there\'s a chance it is, go to see Dr. Oshtory. He\'s your best chance to get back to living your life pain free.'),(3807,297,5,'Well it\'s been 6 weeks and I can finally stand up straight!

Watch out for this doctor, or you could be in the same situation and looking for a real doctor!'),(3809,297,5,'It may not be often that a patient writes to compliment a doctor after being told not to have surgery.Dr. Oshtory told me 4 months ago that I was not a surgical candidate. He assured me that my MRI would certainly identify something he could operate on, but advised that it would most likely not alleviate my lower back pain. He suggested that I continue targeted exercises and that this would stimulate improvement.

How a physiciansurgeon treats their patients is the first priority, but care givers are often overlooked as a part of the process. I can\'t tell you how available Dr. Oshtory was to me before, during and after surgery. I dropped by the office a few days post surgery to pick up a prescription. I had a fair number of questions about my husband\'s progress and Dr. Oshtory spent more than 15 minutes during his lunch time with me to answer my questions and address my concerns. Surgery is stressful for the patient and for care givers, finding a surgeon that can make us all feel at ease is a big score.Orthopedic surgery can\'t cure everyone and everything and that can be frustrating for some patients to accept; that is not a shortcoming of the surgeon, but a reality of medicine.'),(3811,297,5,'Herniated a disc in my lower back.

Unfortunately I couldn\'t take the pain and decided on surgery.After surgery the herniarelated pain was gone. I experienced tingling versions of it over the following few months as expected but was enjoying a trip to Disneyland 2 weeks after surgery. Physical therapist was impressed by the small size of the incision site. Somewhere between months 23 I felt normal.

Mind you my husband used to ride his back and is a Mechanic before all this pain occurred. The doctor didn\'t even go over the spine and how it functions. We brought MRI\'s .. He didn\'t even look at them!! A 10 minute appointment to say my husband needs a stronger back was a joke!

He told me I could do some physical therapy or even pilates to strengthen my core but this wasn\'t a surgical problem and he seemed completely uninterested in figuring it out. I was there to figure out what\'s going on and why I have back pain, not because I needed surgery. I paid my copay at the office and of course they billed me for it as well, so I had to leave a message to their billing department that never got back to me.

I was told way back when I originally got my back injury that if I had surgery it would be better for me in the long run but I\'d be out for 16 weeks. At the time it wasn\'t an option. So I tried to do PT and drugs to get some relief. After 2 years I finally had a consult with Dr. Oshtory.Does he have huggyfeelyletsdoyoga bedside manner? NO. He\'s a surgeon. He\'s to the point, he tells you like it is, and he\'s as nice about it as possible. He is there to give you your surgical options. Don\'t go unless you\'ve explored every other option. But nobody wants to hear that they need hardware and to be cut in half in order to have a chance at a normal life again, not even me so to come to terms with that was hard. But even though I didn\'t feel like hugging it out with Dr. Oshtory after my consult, I knew he was probably as brilliant of a surgeon as he acted, seemed to really know exactly what he was talking about, he came highly recommended by 2 different sports doctors as well as both of my physical therapists, and frankly all that combined made me believe I was going to be in good hands. I won\'t go into the gory details of what I had done, it was as hard core as you can get, my spine was severely jacked up, the surgery was horrible to have done, and nothing can prepare you for how horrible recovery is. It\'s worse then you can imagine. I am thankful NOBODY sugarcoated that for me. I knew exactly what I was signing up for and I\'m glad I was told straight.It\'s been 6 months since Dr. Oshtory opened me up and put in rods and screws and bone grafts... and I feel like a new person. All that pain, misery, fear... all worth it because had Dr. Oshtory not performed the surgery, I\'d be a billion times worse. He uses cutting edge technology and methods, and is extremely precise. The best part is he also knows how to cut you up then give you a pretty scar because of his residency I think he told me at a plastic surgeon\'s office. I don\'t know if I\'m 100% healed, but I can say I\'m a good 95%, and that is better then I could have asked for.'),(3818,297,5,'I recently celebrated the third anniversary of my back surgery and want to share with you some of my preback surgery life and my experiences with Dr. Oshtory. I am now almost 68 years old. I started having back problems in my late 20s. Many years later I was finally diagnosed with scoliosis, stenosis and degenerative discs. It wasn\'t too bad at first, but the problems and the pain progressively worsened over the years. I finally reached a point where the pain was constant and excruciating, and my quality of life was horrible. I had trouble functioning and was exhausted from lack of sleep. I was hunched over to one side, had trouble standing up and felt like a broken pretzel when I got out of bed in the morning.                              I am SO glad that I discovered Dr. Oshtory. He has DRAMATICALLY changed and improved my life for the better with the surgery that he performed on me three years ago. I now sleep like the proverbial baby. I now lead a very active and busy life: traveling all over the world 87 countries & will do 5 more this year, heavy duty exercising 810 hours per week, playing with my grandchildren, and so much more. I can stand up straight. My pain has been significantly reduced. He never promised me a miracle or that I would be pain free. He dealt with the scoliosis, stenosis, degenerative discs and reconstructed my entire spine during the two days of my back surgery.                                                            I think that Dr. Oshtory is an OUTSTANDING doctor and surgeon. He is very knowledgeable, skilled and an expert in his profession. He genuinely cared about me as a patient and really listened to my problems.

I\'ve had too many arrogant doctors who are the absolute opposite of gods. Dr. Oshtory is the most humble, kind and brilliant doctor I\'ve ever known... and I\'m completely stymied by those who think he is not.I had spinal stenosis and his technique was nothing short of a miracle. I went from completely debilitating pain and partial paralysis to being able to climb mountains in a matter of months! This lessinvasive technique is brilliant. My recovery was quick, and my healing process was virtually painless... and this is major back surgery!!I can\'t imagine a better surgeon. Dr. Oshtory was immediate in his responses during my recovery... even on Memorial Day, when he was out with his family. He was thorough in his answers and followed up with a call. I have complete trust in this man. I have recommended him to anyone I know with back issues and will continue to do so.Dr. Oshtory can NOT fix everyone\'s back issues. There are just too many things that can go wrong with a back for this great doctor to be able to cure all. What he does, works miracles for those who need his specialized procedure.Dr. Oshtory was recommended to me. I am thankful every day for that recommendation and for this great doctor.

I needed a spinal fusion in my neck, and he performed a DTRAX procedure that only required a tiny incision instead of my being opened up. Anything with the spine is scary, so this procedure eliminated lots of my concerns. I had this done 6 weeks ago and am starting PT now. I can\'t say I am fully healed yet, but my worst symptoms prior to surgery are gone. I can sit at my desk again, and I can drive without pain, numbing and tingling in my arm.

I had been in pain and suffering from sciatica off and on since Aug 2009. Over the course of the next several years, the pain worsened until I was barely able to function, was downing painkillers, including morphine which I did not like to do. My primary care physician was reluctant to refer me to a back doctor until I absolutely begged him to.Dr Oshtory saw me within a day after I called him, and was able to tell me what he needed to do right away. It seemed like a fairly simple operation and he said it would take care of my pain and the sciatica. He answered all of my questions and was excellent at speaking with a layperson in a way that I could understand, while not talking down to me.The night after the surgery I had a question and wanted to speak to him on the phone about it. I gave my message to the nurse and hoped he would call me as it was already around 9.30 at night. Shortly after, Dr Oshtory showed up at my room in the hospital and answered my question and put me at ease. I was highly impressed by this. He said he was in the neighborhood, but still  how many docs would come by in person late in the evening and be so gracious?He also has a terrific sense of humor, and answers emails very quickly. I cannot tell you how much better my back is. I am not 100% pain free, and occasionally have slight discomfort but I am able to function as a normal person again, being able to walk about two miles at a stretch, go to Pilates twice a week, and do all the things I need in the house, like cook, do the laundry, etc which I was not able to do in the few months preceding the surgery. I can even travel again.I am so grateful to Dr. Oshtory and he truly changed my life around.

I was in so much pain that I couldn\'t walk or sit for longer than 5 min. it was horrible. I saw a chiropractor for about 2 months twice a day and spent lots of money but came to the realization that I the chiropractor was not going to make this pain and numbness go away.

Certainly NOT.My visit to Dr. Oshtory is with out a doubt the very worst experience I have ever had with a physician. In fact, he may be the rudest individual I have ever met. I literally walked out of his office after 5 minutes of consultation with him. HE IS HORRIBLE!!All I wanted him to do was look at my images from the emergency room and look at the state of my spine after an injury in September.Given that St. Mary\'s told me my neck was broken before taking a closer look at my xray I thought I had, you know, a REASONABLE premise for my visit.He was horrible to me. He was so aggressive I had to walk out. LITERALLY.this man is simply awful and I would deter anyone from seeing him. There are plenty of talented surgeons that will treat you like human being.'),(3829,297,5,'Dr. Oshtory is on of the finest Doctors I have ever seen.I have had major pain and seen far too many Doctors.I am the type of person that hates going to the Doctor!!!Dr.Oshtory made my experience so much more cofortable than Iever expected. He was able to suggest non invasive options that immediately gave me the most relief!!In addition I was able to avoid extremely costly procedures such as an MRI. If you are looking for an incredible Doctor,Dr. Oshtory is someone that will have your Back!!!He will always make you a priority and listen towhat you are feeling.I am ever so thankful to have had such a great experience!!!Thank you so much Dr. Oshtory for making my visit so great.'),(3830,297,1,'Hands down the worst doctor I have ever encountered. Very curious how he gets either 1 star or 5 stars...After years of being in constant pain 79, he not only genuinely unconcerned, but clearly didn\'t believe a word of my daily experience. Condescending remark after condescending remark led to the end of a 10 minute discussion resulting in a recommendation for PT; that was it...no surgery or further test or even a glimmer of concern in contrast to all the doctors opinions leading to my visit.Please do not support this farce of a medical practitioner. I wouldn\'t trust him to prescribe me aspirin as he would find someway to mess even that up and make my life worse for trusting him. The quicker he losses patients and must retire the safer everyone in this city will be.With so many other doctors available in the bay, please take a few extra minutes to do some research or drive the extra mile to see someone who takes the Hippocratic oath to heart and will treat you with respect.'),(3831,297,1,'Now I know why it was so easy to get an appointment with Dr. Oshtory. It\'s actually bizarre how blatantly rude and condescending this man is. Easily the worst experience I\'ve ever had with a physician.'),(3832,297,5,'Just wanted to say a huge thank you to Dr. Oshtory. He talked me off the ledge of having some pretty serious back surgery after a nasty crash and instead going on the tons of physical therapy route.I have pretty minimal day to day pain and am leading my motorcycle racing series this year, and am back to doing what I love.Thanks Dr. Oshtory!'),(3833,297,5,'In December 2012, I developed acute low back pain and nerve pain. The Emergency Room doctor recommended I see Dr. Oshtory as soon as possible. Fortunately, he was able to see me immediately and scheduled my surgery a few days later. Dr. Oshtory is a skilled surgeon and he is highly regarded by his peers. He came to see me after the surgery and explained the outcome in terms I could understand. Besides being a good surgeon, his mannerisms are excellent. He listens to me and I never feel like he is too busy or my concerns are of no importance. Dr. Oshtory even responds to emails unlike most doctors. He is very gracious and I am so glad I found him  the surgery he performed probably prohibited permanent nerve damage. I highly recommend Dr. Oshtory if you have chronic back problems. He is EXCELLENT!'),(3834,297,1,'This is only the 2nd review I have ever written on Yelp but, I had such strong opinions after my appointment with Dr. Oshtory, that I felt it was necessary to warn other patients. My experience was very similar to Dana H 9262013.First of all, I got an appointment on the same day that I called and there were no other patients in the office  now I understand why. After filling out the paperwork and waiting 1015 minutes for the doctor to actually see me I could see him walking around the office doing nothing, his demeanor was so arrogant and condescending that I was taken aback. I described my symptoms: pain, numbness in my toes, sciatica etc. I explained that the last MRI, from 10 years earlier had shown disc degeneration and stenosis and inquired if the numbness in my toes was a result of this. He brushed my question off, told me that stenosis does not cause toe numbness and that it was probably caused by diabetes or high blood pressure  I have neither. He kept repeating that he was a surgeon and was angry that he was receiving referrals for patients who didn\'t wantneed surgery  it was a waste of his time. He recommended isometrics and wanted to refer me to someone that would control my symptoms by pain management, i.e. more drugs! I left his office insulted and angry.My doctor referred me to a different back specialist, who ordered a new MRI. The result is that the stenosis has indeed worsened, and will probably continue to do so, requiring surgery in a few years. Not only does the stenosis begin with toe numbness, it progresses to leg weakness and nerve damage.My recommendation would be to stay as far away from this doctor as possible. I have been hearing a lot about people being paid to post false positive reviews and my impression is that this has occurred for this doctor. Beware!!!'),(3835,297,5,'In July 2012 I herniated a disc in my low back which caused significant pain, numbness and weakness in one of my legs. My sports medicine physician here in San Francisco provided me with his three best recommendations for surgeons specializing in backspine related injuries, namely Drs. Weber, Andrews and Oshtory. He characterized these three as the very best surgeons out there, with Dr. Oshtory having particularly leading edge techniques in a range of procedures including microdiscectomy for which I was a candidate. Just as importantly, my sports medicine doctor knew my personality well and suggested that Dr. Oshtory would be a particularly strong fit given his very collaborative, patientcentric approach.Dr. Oshtory\'s office got me in for an appointment literally the day my MRI results became available. He conducted a thorough review of the imaging, did a battery of strength and other tests in the office, and then presented me with a balanced perspective on potential paths forward. He was very forthcoming with empirical data around my type of injury and success rates in treatment so that I felt comfortable making an informed decision. Furthermore, his calm demeanor and genuine interest in my full recovery really put me at ease. I elected to have a microdiscectomy and was in for surgery a week later. I did do my diligence on Dr. Oshtory, asking other physicians I trusted about Oshtory\'s reputation, and the commentary came back very favorably. In short, his reputation is as strong as his academic and practicing credentials.The decision to have the surgery was a good one. Make no mistake, and as advertised by Dr. Oshtory, the recovery from significant back injuries is not easy. Dr. Oshtory made sure to see me at regular intervals. In the weeks and months following the surgery, there were times when I had questions and needed reassurances as to whether my recovery was on track or not. I have never come across a doctor, let alone a surgeon with his credentials, who is as responsive as Dr. Oshtory. I email with him frequently a form of communication which is rare with doctors to begin with and he responds to me very quickly. I consider myself very lucky to have been recommended to such a skilled and compassionate surgeon and in turn am confident in providing the strongest endorsement possible of Dr. Oshtory.'),(3836,297,5,'The best surgeon I\'ve ever met. Very knowledgeable & kind & caring. He listened to patients well. He is known as very good surgeon who handles complicated cases I also work in medical field, but won\'t make surgery as the only result right away, which some surgeon do. Excellent bedside manner, very patient and compassionate. I felt understood by him about my difficulty due to back injury. Highly recommended.'),(3837,297,5,'Dr Oshtory helped me recover from some acute lower back and sciatica symptoms very quickly. His approach to do a noninvasive cortisone injection before looking at surgery brought me great relief within a few days after the injection and it\'s gottne better after. He\'s also very pleasant and treats his patient\'s extremely well. Can\'t say enough about him!'),(3838,297,5,'My surgery date is tomorrow. My experience with Dr. Oshtory is already so significant, I feel I can post a review now. I expect to be very happy with my outcomes. I would post again if my experience does not match my expectations, but I think that will be unlikely.Ray Oshtory is my perfect doctor. He\'s got a reassuring educational pedigreeMIT, UCLA, Stanford, teaching position at Stanford where he taught spinal surgeryand he\'s young and personable, as well. Finding Dr. Oshtory *now*, before he\'s got so many patients that he can only spend a normal amount of time with you, is like going to work for Google when it was just a funny name. He gives you a luxurious amount of time and really cares that you understand and feel confident about your surgery. Most people with degenerative disc disease want pain relief, but I was athletic and a dancer, and I cared about mobility as well. I fended off fusion surgery for two years. Dr. Oshtory understood my concerns about trading mobility for pain relief, decided to do a minimally invasive surgery though still radical, and was insightful enough to point out that I was already using my body differently to compensate and would not notice much change after a fusion. His understanding why I didn\'t want a fusion was the reason he was able to convince me I needed one. He also dealt with my insurance company, whose policy was not to pay for this surgical method XLIF. He got them to reverse their decision and permanently change their policy on this thennew procedure. He was also supportive, available by email and phone, during the anxious weeks of waiting for the insurance and scheduled surgery at my convenience. Post op:Operation took 6 hours. I was nauseous afterward. Dr. Oshtory grabbed a bite and then came back to the hospital stayed with me 3 more hours until I was better. He visited twice a day. I had to walk with someone every day, and he took me walking himself once. I couldn\'t have gotten more attention if I was a visiting dignitary. I had a bad night after I went home and I called him in the middle of the night. He was patient and concerned and encouraged me to call any time. We also emailed, and he responds quickly. I had a fourlevel lumbar fusion and was walking without help by the fourth day. The only immediate problem was nausea, and my stomach is unusually sensitive anyway. I\'m so cynical and have had so many bad medical experiences, I\'m stunned at how different this has been for me. This is a great doctor, especially if you are a bit younger than the average back patient, athletic and can understand and want to to discuss the surgery in detail and at a deeper level. But do take your elderly mother to him, because he is kind and reassuring and good at what he does. He does a variety of orthopedic surgeries, not just the extremely challenging ones like mine. I can\'t recommend him enough.Post op complication: I had mysterious pain in my left leg that wasn\'t getting better after a week. I emailed Dr. Oshtory and he said, Don\'t eat after midnight. We\'re doing a treatment tomorrow. The office manager scrambled to find an MRI appointment early enough to allow a treatment the same day. The MRI showed a minuscule contact between an implant and a nerve. He gave me a steroid shot for the pain that day and performed a short surgery a few days later to remove the part of the implant that touched the nerve. A week later, I feel none of the pain from the problem. In fact, I feel practically no pain at all, six weeks after the original surgery and a week after the second one. When this complication happened and I understand that spinal fusion surgery has a high rate of complications, few of them as simple as mine Dr. Oshtory communicated perfectly with me. I understood the problem and the planned surgery. I was shown the MRI, both before and after the surgery. In fact, I was shown the xrays of the my lumbar spine before and after the original surgery. If I can\'t have my normal spine back, I could not ask for a prettier, straighter spine than the one Dr. Oshtory gave me.1713 I\'m delighted so many patients have had the same experience I did. No one I meet suspects I have a spinal fusion, much less a massive one. I have no remaining symptoms of degenerative disc disease, and can dance and hike my favorite activities, even though I also have two artificial hips. Based on the few negative reviews, I\'d say see this doc if you have a genuine problem that you can discuss intelligently, not just a need for validation. If it\'s your neck, tell the doc where, when and how it hurts. Do you have symptoms? Another doctor\'s xray reading mistake, quickly corrected, is not a reason to see a back surgeon months later in the absence of symptoms. PPOs all pay a share of costs of out of network docs, but they get to decide if they think your issue is legitimate. If they think the visit is unnecessary, they will not pay.'),(3839,297,5,'Dr. Oshtory is a spine surgeon, and in our opinion, the best in San Francisco.Dr. Oshtory did WONDERS for my mom! Our first appointment with him was midMarch. My mom lives in San Francisco and was really nervous when her regular doctor suggested she see a surgeon, so I went with her. I took my mom in to see him because she had horrible sciatica and had tried every other form of treatment physical therapy, acupuncture, etc.He listened to my mom\'s complaints, asked important questions, examined her and had her get an MRI the next morning. He even predicted what it would show!After the results of the MRI came back, he gave us a lot of important information on the treatments available for her pain which was caused by pinched nerves in her back. My mom was freaked out but Dr. Oshtory assured her it wasn\'t dangerous. We took that information, researched, spoke to family, Googled and ultimately decided to take it slow and proceed down the conservative treatment path step by step. Dr. Oshtory was all for it, and didn\'t try to pressure my mom into surgery.  We then booked a follow up appointment, mostly because my mom wasn\'t getting any better, and also to talk about additional questions we had and some of the research we had done about the surgery. I greatly appreciated him being available to simply discuss treatments with us and ease our nerves. He was very patient with us and answered all our questions and concerns. He even responds to emails the same day.This past Tuesday, Dr. Oshtory performed a microsurgery on her back. Needless to say I was extremely nervous, for my mom. After the surgery was complete, he came down to the waiting room and reassured us that everything went well, and would check back on her later that day. She left the hospital the next morning with none of the pain in her legs that she had before the surgery albeit her back was a little sore from the incision.My mom is now a week into recovery and feels so much better! She hasn\'t even taken any pain medicine for a few days now! He really is a fabulous doctor.

Really?? Really.... I thought people went to a doctor to find a cure and although he was completely confident it wasn\'t the bulging disc causing my pain, he wasn\'t at all sure how to recommend a permanent cure other than a pain shot and isometric exercise. His exact words were If that doesn\'t work I have nothing else to recommend. In other words Learn to live with it. So disappointing. He is missing the compassion and human relation aspect of his job 100%.

It\'s so refreshing to find a Dr. who doesn\'t rush through your appointment and genuinely seems to care about your well being. He\'s truly devoted to the craft of healing, it\'s clear that\'s his passion. He spent at least 12 hour to an hour with me at each visit, so rare these days to get that much attention! I also left each appointment with very detailed notes that he provided, about my diagnosis, healing and treatment.

However, what his office refused to admit even after much go around claiming against all statements and evidence to the contrary that Anthem did not have them on their provider list, is that Dr. Markison won\'t accept the lower Anthem MediCal reimbursement rate.

And I could care less about what kind of chairs are in the waiting room. I pulled my radial lateral ligament. I think that\'s what it is. I believe most surgeons would have directed me toward surgery, but Dr. Markison suggested we see if heals on its own first. I\'m extremely thankful for that. We splinted my thumb up and after a couple of months the ligament reattached on its own. Brilliant. My visits with the good doctor went far beyond just healing my thumb. He directed me to Dragon Dictation software, which has already saved me oooodles of time in my business and life. He also shared the story of how important our thumbs are, which I can really appreciate now. I\'m also going to explore his suggestion of going off the gluten. I am VERY picky when it comes to doctors, and I\'m glad I made the choice to visit Dr. Markison.

It certainly feels like they overcharged for xrays nearly $200 for three pics and an extremely low dose cortisone shot, in addition to his time. I have paid less for far more value from other orthopedic docs. While I appreciate that he tired to be thoughtful about making a diagnosis, he was over the top and had me sit there while he entered everything into the computer.

Markison is an expert in the latest and least invasive corrective technology, called Manos. Manos is different from traditional Carpal Tunnel Release surgery in that it\'s handled arthroscopically, it\'s stitchless and requires little down time. I saw him once at the very end of last year to confirm that my Carpal needed real attention and then it took me a few months to decide to pull the trigger. Once I was ready, I scheduled the surgery for a recent Friday morning so that I\'d have the weekend to recuperate. I opted for a local anesthetic instead of general, and, after laying low on FriSat I felt great by Sunday. The attention and care provided by Dr. Markison was outstanding. Dr. M is a very humorous, very intelligent man. I could sit and talk with him for hours and at one of my appts I did!. He has a great bedside manner  there\'s no getting rushed out of his office for his next appointment. He creates a calm, inviting environment that puts the patient at ease. And, what I find most fascinating about him is that in addition to being a spectacular hand surgeon, he is a self taught artist, musician, glass blower, shoe maker and designer, and the list goes on and on. He uses his hands in so many creative ways  his office filled with some of his treasures. That kind of creativity and medical intellectualism is a duality I\'ve never seen and made him so human and approachable. While some doctors can be somewhat intimidating, Dr. M\'s casual yet professional nature made the experience so relatable.

Because the surgery was performed at St. Mary\'s, the experience was totally seamless  the entire staff was awesome  and I was in and out in just a few hrs. After hours care. Dr. M called me over the weekend to make sure I felt alright and didn\'t have any questions. He even gave me his cell phone number so that I could phone him if necessary That never happens!

I\'ve had several intense doctorhospitalsurgical traumas starting as a toddler. I had meniscus surgery 3 years ago at UCSF and was petrified due to PTSD. For this procedure though, I had so much confidence in Dr. Markison from 17 years ago, amazingly, I was looking forward to the surgery. I knew the surgery would be performed impeccably and the De Quervain\'s tendon pain would be gone soon. I struggled a little in the middle of surgery, but before and after that I was actually able to relax with confidence in his astute knowledge, skill, and sincere desire to relieve my pain. Healing is going extremely well. I only had to take one pain pill post op and I am using my hand more and more. I am a very happy camper. As I said, 5 Stars is not nearly enough.

I\'ve already referred two people to him, and would do it again.'),(3859,298,5,'Dr. Markison is a true healer, clearly an expert and beyond that, keenly interested in his work, and enhancing the human essence, translated into manual dexterity.

Heavy labor over the years brought me back for other reasons, and every time I knew I was getting his full attention, and the best options for my needs. And every time I was brought back to either full or better functionality than before. Further, Dr. Markison has an open mind, and if an alternative therapy or modality works, or might work, he is willing to study it and implement it. He is willing to have ideas, and discuss yours without evident judgement. I never felt I was asking a stupid question.  Not because they weren\'t in fact stupid, because they well may have been...but because Dr. Markison was open to discussing them, and studying up on them and reporting back on his findings.. His commitment to the result makes him refreshingly egoless, which is not a characteristic of many surgeons.  My husband recently did have to have surgery, and while prepping, I noted that Dr. Markison took time to greet every one of the surgical nursing staff by name, and make personal detailed inquiries about them as well.He clearly knew and respected his team, they knew and respected his in return and all of that showed in the excellent result. I have usually been disappointed in the medical profession, with Doctors that seem more interested in deciding what code they can assign to the visit so they can call the 5 minute session a complex visit justifying 6 different billings.

I\'ve been to him for a trigger finger  that after more conservative treatment ended with a successful surgery, and for my daughter\'s ganglion cyst, still an ongoing issue. This is not a big machine of an office, just the doctor and his receptionist, Anna. Yes, I\'ve had to wait sometimes, but the flip side of that is that Dr. Markison will spend the time to explain, educate and support you.

I\'ve recommended him and will continue to do so.'),(3864,298,5,'Dr. Markison is the most amazing doctor I have seen in my entire life. After being extremely frustrated for several years from seeing a series of cursory, nonchalant physicians for my hand condition, I saw Dr. Markison as a refreshing exception. For starters, rather than taking me directly to the patient\'s room, we went into his personal office, where he listened very patiently and intently about the history of my condition and the symptoms I have been feeling. Then, he literally took out textbooks from his bookshelves to educate me on the hand anatomy and related biomechanics, while making sure I understood how to integrate this knowledge into my daily activities and in ways that would maximize the probability of my recovery. He patiently answered every question I asked, and was encouraging in the process; this is in stark contrast to many of the other doctors I visited, who were too much in a rush to even acknowledge my concerns, let alone encourage me to voice them. After a thorough conversation, Q&A session, and anatomy 101, Dr. Markison wrote a very detailed, prescribed treatment plan. He brought to light various areas of the body i.e. certain vitaminhormone deficiencies I should have checked outside of the immediately obvious, the hand; this highlighted his intimate knowledge of the body\'s interconnectedness. This was important for me, because up until now, no physician had yet been able to prescribe a detailed, comprehensive treatment plan.On top of all his expertise, thoroughness, patience, humility and compassion, you can easily tell that Dr. Markison is personally committed to his profession. He is a surgeon, musician, and painter who views the hand as the true instrument in our daily lives. He has given me renewed hope, and I give him my highest possible recommendation.'),(3865,298,1,'If you want to get the WRONG diagnose, if you want to get SCAMMED, if you want to go through hell with your insurance company, if you like rude people and if you just enjoy wasting money on nothing, then THIS guy is guy to see!

Basically there\'s a new procedure that is done on newborns as it has the most success when started within 2 weeks of birth, which we did. Everything is external, no surgery, it\'s basically a little splint they put on the ear one of our sons had a slightly cupped ear, and then the top of his other ear was a little flat. Our other son had the slightly flat top part on both ears and then put a little plastic cover over it and tape it to the skin. Sure, it looks a little funny and we got plenty of questions about \'what\'s wrong, they basically looked like water polo players, but the ears look amazing! The treatment is 6 weeks long for most with minor issues and they\'re changed out every 2 weeks both because of ear growth and just because they get gross after that long. It takes about 20 minutes to get everything in place on both ears. We saw progress each time we went in and by the time they came off, the ears looked great and now 4 months later, they still look amazing. Basically we were told that the ears are still so malleable that early on, that you\'re essentially just reshaping the ear without doing anything invasive. Again, this needs to be done early to be most successful as that cartilage starts to set with each day older they get. I think some issues clear up themselves within the first 2 weeks of life, but our pedi told us at our 2week appointment that if it would\'ve corrected itself, it would have by 2 weeks old so that\'s when we decided to get something done.

Since this is not what one expects for a traditional massage, this style should have been communicated to me before scheduling the appointment.I still gave her a shot since I was already there: Kristina and I spoke before getting started and I made it very clear my lower lumbar was achy from a past, healed strain, and that\'s where I wanted her to focus. In addition, I expressed how disappointed I was when past massage therapists ignored the area, never touching it, after clearly explaining my needs. I shared that I was well aware that joining muscle groups surrounding achy areas could be effecting things and that it was fine for her to work on those areas as well. I clearly communicated that I wanted her to touch meaning work on my lumbar L5S1.

The second shock was when she actually listened to me explain my lifestyle and where I experienced discomfort and then asked probing questions to find out more about my unique situation  most places think they know you better than yourself. The third shock was when I slept soundly through the night after one session!! Seriously, this is HUGE. And I\'ve only had to see her about 3 times because I\'ve seen such drastic improvements.Want more proof? I just ran my first half and full marathon this year.

I\'ve had back and knee pain for several years 10 years and insist on exercising despite the pain, and I\'ve finally had enough.

He was able to diagnose and treat my acute problem area. I was concerned I was going to have something chronic but he assured me things will be better in a few days, do the following steps as he outlined, and sure enough, I am completely cured!I would certainly recommend Dr. Nguyen and his office for any patients that are dealing with any foot, ankle, sportsrelated problems.'),(3964,302,2,'I\'m writing this review based on my personal experience at FDFAC and with Dr. Sanders. I am happy for those who have had good experiences at this center; however, I can\'t second that. My experience in terms of dealing with the staff at FDFAC and with Dr. Sanders directly was far from bad and in fact I will commend them for being really sweet and accommodating. However, bottom line is that I was misdiagnosed not once, but twice and I think it\'s important that I share this so other users can make informed decisions. I came in to FDFAC in July after my ankle swelled up and I felt excruciating pain all of a sudden while I was at work preface: I do wear heels and workout pretty hard. I typically do a lot of reviews and research on yelp before going ahead with a decision but in this case, I was desperate and was very happy they were able to take me in and see me. I wish I had read the bad reviews because it seems like there is a trend that can\'t be missed...Upon arrival  the gentleman who greeted me was pleasant; he requested me to fill out papers and arranged for me to elevate my ankle and even gave me chocolates as I was in pain sweet gesture. I was then led to the room by a nurse who questioned my symptoms etc and took down notes. Then I was taken in for xrays not sure why xrays were taken even before the doctor had seen me but, oh well. Dr. Sanders extremely friendly and personable arrived shortly after and was in the room with me for approximately 35 minutes. I am aware she is busy, but I would have felt much better if there was a more thorough examination done before her diagnosis. I think the biggest downfall for FDFAC is the 3 to 5 min doctorpatient interaction which could result in misdiagnosis. I was diagnosed with a stresshairline fracture and immediately put into a soft cast and told to wear boots for the next 6 to 8 weeks. I was also told I would need an MRI. I left FDFAC feeling really disheartened and a little confused as to how what felt like a sprain turned out to be a stress fracture. Anyway, they\'re the experts and in my mind I figured, better to be safe than sorry  and was hopeful that the MRI would be more telling. Surprise, surprise, I didn\'t really have to wait for the MRI because by nightfall, the pain i felt and the swelling had subsided. I still went in for the MRI as I trusted Dr. Sanders at that point uggh, Dr. Sanders had prescribe the MRI for the wrong ankle. Anyway, MRI done  I requested Health Diagnostics to send the results to Dr. Sanders that very day so I could have her let me know the results and move on along with my normal life i.e. workout, get out of the cast & boots etc. She said she couldn\'t read the MRI as she was super busy totally understandable and suggested I keep my appointment scheduled for the following week. Days went by and I felt fully fine  so I decided I would cancel my appointment. I got a call soon after and was told by Dr. Sanders that I didn\'t have a stress fracture but I had considerable swelling that is consistent with damage, injury, compression of the cartilage UGGGH and that she needed to see me. I immediately felt sick to my stomach  how can I feel fully fine and have such considerable damage as Dr. Sanders noted from my MRI. My gut reaction was to go and read all the yelp reviews again  and that\'s when I determined I needed a second opinion and that I didn\'t trust Dr. Sander\'s diagnosis. I received several calls from Dr. Sanders after that...but at this point, I questioned intent....so I didn\'t go back to her. So yes, at this point I am mentally uneasy Tip: don\'t google and try to self diagnose lol. I scheduled an appointment with another doctor who I will review after this Dr. Chueng. Drumroll....does anyone want to take a wild guess on what she said......Yup, nothing wrong with my ankle!!!!!!....Dr. Chueng looked hard for the cartilage damage in my MRI results and found nothing except some fluid that was a result of the swelling caused by the sprained ankle. I\'m no doctor, but a simple sprain was misdiagnosed as a stress fracture and damage to cartilage by someone who is an expert and that\'s what is really troublesome. I am not as upset about the $$$ spent on the misdiagnosis but am really troubled that I would have been put through treatment that was not necessary and also for the psychological impact the experience had overall.I wanted to believe Dr. Sanders and team have their patients\' best interest at heart but unfortunately, my experience makes me wonder. I am not concluding that Dr. Sanders purposely misdiagnosed me and wanted to make a quick buck  she could have genuinely made a mistake on her diagnosis  but I guess I will never really know and I\'m not sure I want to find out..... Lessons learnt: read yelp reviews, listen to your body, get second opinions if you suspect you have been misdiagnosed, don\'t google and self diagnose..it will drive u mad, lol'),(3965,302,2,'I would like to echo what other patients have said about Dr. Sanders. She spent 5 minutes or less with me during two of my visits. Put me in a walking boot and told me to see her in 4 weeks. Luckily I got a second opinion from a different doctor who sent me for a MRI to determine the real issue. Dr. Sanders wanted to keep me in a boot for 8 plus weeks for a simple toe fracture without exploring if there was tissue damage. Her exam involved an x ray, where she said my 4 week follow up showed a more severe fracture. I started to lose confidence in her from this point on. Her exam was not hands on or thorough in my opinion. Also while being in the boot 8 plus weeks she said I would not need PT while the second opinion contradicted this by saying I would need it so I do not develop a gimpy walk.'),(3966,302,5,'I\'ve been seeing Dr. Jenny Sanders and her team for many years now, and they are AMAZING. They\'re professional, they\'re incredibly likable  and they get you \'back on your feet\' quickly.So far I\'ve been through a stress fracture on top of my foot, a broken ankle, and two pairs of orthotics ...

For over a year, he recommended stretching and ice, fit me for orthotics, performed Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy, but never did an MRI. After 18 months of continued pain, I made an appointment with Dr. Nguyen at FDFAC and within 15 minutes, he used a portable Ultra Sound unit to determine the right Plantar tendon was twice the thickness of the left normal tendon and inflamed, indicating a possible tear. He recommended an MRI which confirmed the tear, so I was provided a compression sock and immobilization boot to wear for 6  8 weeks. The exact opposite of stretching!At the midpoint he used the Ultra Sound to confirmed the tendon was healing and after 6 weeks, I was allowed to stop wearing the boot. My foot feels better than it has in 2 years. No more middle of the night trips over broken glass!

I had previously been to a different podiatrist who provided me with little guidance and never followed up with me for a second appointment. My expectations were low but when I came into this office I was instantly relieved.The clean and comfortable office has free snacks and water bottles in the waiting area. The front desk receptionists are friendly  sure some aren\'t overly peppy but I\'ve always received good customer service from them. The technology here is amazing. At my old podiatrist they took Xrays and had to have me come back to view the prints. Here the Xrays can be viewed on an iPad with your doctor a few minutes after taking them. It was so helpful to see the Xrays up close! I was also evaluated and recorded on a treadmill to see how my walking and running stance was affecting my discomfort. They even helped me pick out three running shoes from Zappos and tested all three out to find the best fit. They then returned the two shoes that were not selected.Dr. Sanders is super friendly and bubbly and she really seems interested in her patients. I will say that the initial evaluation was a little short and hurried with Dr. Sanders but I do not think that she would stop a session early if there was anything left truly unresolved. You do end up spending a fair amount of time with a doctor\'s assistant however, they are under the guidance of Dr. Sanders so I never had an issue with this.I feel like for the first time that there is a team dedicated in making sure that my problems are resolved. Love this place!'),(3969,302,1,'The patient service was alright, not great, but I got what I was looking for out of the appointments. The initial visit I saw the PA for most of the time who took history and did an initial exam of my feet. After that Dr. Nguyen came in for ~2 min, gave a diagnosis and then had the PA answer other questions I had. The second followup visit happened about 1 month later, again saw Dr. Nguyen for ~5 minutes and he did not volunteer much information, I felt like I had to really probe to get the answers for questions I was looking for. On top of mediocre bedside manner and rushed office visits, I was sent a bill for the first appointment after I had already been to the followup. The office staff failed to tell me that despite not having an office visit copay there was a significant deductible I would be forced to pay. If I had know this after the first visit, I would have been fine, but having to pay 2 separate greater than $100 bills out of pocket for less than 5 minute office visits seems a bit absurd.

This place is all about billing, and egos. I came here in March with what was evaluated as an ankle sprain. This place, at least Dr. Nguyen, is the classic egotistical doctor, without bedside manner. The short story is that he misdiagnosed, and treated me for months as though I was going to wind up crippled without a lot of expenses. Almost $10,000 in bills later, for medical equipment, injections, etc etc  NONE OF IT WAS NEEDED OR NECESSARY. To add a little more color on the horrible practices: I went for an MRI after 5 weeks of not healing properly. The MRI showed after second opinion something mild which was \'interpreted\' by this Dr as a \'major fracture\' requiring a $6000 piece of med equipment. To add to the this, he also charged over $100 to read the results of the MRI he ordered. In all my life, I\'ve never had a doctor charge to read lab results for tests ordered. He is also extremely quick with his patients. After being stuck in traffic, I was 3 minutes late for an urgent appt, and he wasn\'t able to see me bc he only had 10 minute appointments. He doesn\'t care about your wellbeing, just his financial calculations. This is also reflected by his front desk, who are always rude, as many have mentioned here on Yelp, and treating people without any respect.After $10k in bills, I saw another doctor at a larger facility and he reviewed all my records  with outrage on what this doctor had done; which has now caused REAL problems. Problems that will require tons of PT, if not surgery soon. He also was outraged about injections that were given which are known causes of the problems I\'m having  and should have never been received.

The only disappointing thing is that I ended up there two years late  I had been struggling with feet issues and at the time I settled for a podiatrist who was innetwork, when multiple friends had URGED me to only see Dr. Sanders and her team. I learned my lesson. After a solid misdiagnosis with one podiatrist and the poor MRI reading by a bad radiologist and a weak regimen prescribed at the otherwise trusty UCSF  where I went frustrated after my first diagnosis, I ended up in Dr. Sanders care. I realized within ten minutes of the consultation that I was FINALLY in the right place  with a doctor who knew there was something terribly wrong. Her and her partner Dr. Nguyen took my case very seriously, reread my MRI, gave me a clear diagnosis that made sense to me  finally and arranged for me to have a surgery. I am beyond grateful to the team here and highly recommend them. As an ex competitive athlete, I know my body, especially my feet, better than the average person and I believe their practice truly understands people who are certain there is something wrong  when others have dismissed or misdiagnosed.

I was patient of the FDFAC for over 2 years and received care from both Dr. Anthony Nguyen and Dr. Jenny Sanders. To sum up my experience, I received adequate care and diagnoses from both doctors, but found the quality of customer service to be extremely poor. The FDFAC\'s business model appears to be skewed to benefit the livelihood of the practice rather than the wellbeing of the patient. It was due to this low level of customer service that I left the office for another physician. As you\'ll read in previous negative reviews, there are some significant drawbacks to choosing the FDFAC:The demeanor of the receptionists is consistently impatient and rude. You\'ll experience this treatment if you ask them any questions related to your condition or their billing policies over the phone. You will find that you are not permitted to speak to your doctor over the phone; you are only able to speak with the receptionists or the doctors\' assistants. In addition, there is no email or messaging portal for this office. Appointments are stacked in very short time slots 1015 minutes, which leads to less consultation time with your doctor. On many occasions, I had less than 2 minutes with my doctor. You\'ll find that the majority of your appointment time is spent with the assistants and feels very rushed. The stacked appointment schedule also leads to an unforgiving late policy. Your appointment will be cancelled if you are over 7 minutes late, and you may be charged with a steep late fee. Take your health seriously, and do not risk your physical or mental health by choosing the FDFAC.'),(3974,302,5,'Dr. Anthony Nguyen is awesome.

The visit lasted a total of 4 minutes and they billed my insurance. Then, when I had to pick up my orthodics, I had to pay again! I also had multiple pairs of orthodics made there using 2 different methods of measurement and every time, I got blisters on my feet. After finally switching offices, I\'m seeing a doctor who can provide orthodics without blisters and fittings without charging me for every visit including those to pick up my orthodics!

Kiri, who assisted Dr. Nguyen in giving me laser treatment on my right foot, was also very personable and greatly alleviated my supposedly painfulanduncomfortable treatment.Professional: I have been to a good number of healthcare facilities. Every time I made an appointment at these places, I was almost certain that it would be at least 1530 minutes late... just tiny bit better than my experience at the DMV. However, people at FDFAC are very punctual. If my appointment was at 4pm, I would see my doctor Dr. Nguyen at 4pm. It has been like this for the past 3 appointments, and I couldn\'t be happier. You know, there\'s a fine line between doctors who just try to get through as many patients as possible $$, and doctors who really care about his patients while not wasting their patients\' time.

Part of me wanted to put a difficult chapter behind me. The other part wondered if other endurance athletes had similar issues. Upon reading Triathlete Dana C\'s review, I felt compelled to tell my story.I\'m an experienced distance runner who was an FDFAC patient in late 2012 9 appointments spanning 3 months. I went to Dr. Jenny Sanders seeking a running shoe reco for my hardtofit narrow feet my goto shoes had been discontinued. I\'d seen Sanders\' online shoe reviews and was impressed  she understood running footwear and modeltomodel nuances.I\'m also a veteran orthotics wearer. I\'d been cycling, spinning and running for 15+ years using the same custom orthotics prescribed by another podiatrist. I believed my orthotics worked just fine, but Sanders insisted I needed new ones. I should have listened to my inner voice, but I trusted Sanders knew what she was doing.The best advice I received from FDFAC was: Don\'t start breaking in these orthotics until after your next marathon. Postmarathon I was injuryfree and in peak condition  a BQ was within reach.I soon began using Sanders\' orthotics, ever so gradually: I started at 3 miles and maxed out at 8 miles by week 3. After each run, my knee didn\'t feel quite right. I should have listened to my body instead of telling myself I must be adjusting to the orthotics. Again, I trusted FDFAC\'s purported expertise in Sports Medicine and Biomechanics.I returned to FDFAC with knee pain and inflammation  Sanders said that In 20+ years of dealing with thousands of runners, I have never had a patient experience your degree of knee pain after wearing orthotics.Worth noting: When I first received the orthotics, FDFAC simply had me WALK down the hallway in them vs. conducting a gait analysis  i.e., running on the treadmill. That should have been a red flag.Once injured, I suggested we compare me running in my old orthotics+shoes vs. the new orthotics+shoes Sanders recommended greater stability  more of a motion control shoe.From the gait analysis, Sanders maintained the new combination was performing perfectly, with the exception of possibly needing a heel lift underneath the right.Sanders referred me to an orthopedic surgeon. An MRI revealed my knee was structurally sound no stress fractureno tears  but I\'d suffered tissue damage. It would take RICE and months to heal.Long story short, after initially going to Sanders solely for a running shoe recommendation, I\'d had 9 appointments, I was now injured and Sanders and I weren\'t seeing eyetoeye on my treatment she\'d also prescribed a corticosteroid  which my GP advised against; the orthopedic surgeon prescribed a nonsteroidNSAID instead.To her credit, Sanders refunded my copays although this didn\'t cover the orthopedic surgeon, MRI and months of PT. The check was accompanied by my medical records and a thoughtful, carefullyworded letter  in which Sanders concluded my knee pain was coincidental to the orthotics.COINCIDENTAL?! Like most competitive athletes, I\'m disciplined and meticulous about my training, my nutrition and my gear. I\'d never had knee problems before, and I know my body better than anyone: the new orthoticsshoes had thrown off my biomechanics and wreaked havoc with my knee.I was sidelined for over four months. I was devastated. I missed races, and had to start over from the beginning. I remember my first 14 mile on the treadmill. It was a long road back.Last Fall, I went to another podiatrist who not only specializes in sports medicine and biomechanics  he happens to be an accomplished ultramarathoner Sanders is not a runner. He videotaped me running in my triedandtrue orthotics and determined they were still working for me  best paired with a lighttomoderate stability shoe.Needing closure on my FDFAC experience, I sought this doctor\'s opinion on Sanders\' orthotics and extreme stability shoes. As we watched the video framebyframe, he affirmed what I\'d known all along: You were overcorrected.Sanders and the FDFAC staff are really nice people  they\'re attentive, and they mean well. Most 5 star reviews are based on these qualities  from patients still in treatment saying FDFAC\'s care has them feeling hopeful.However, if you\'re a resultsoriented endurance athlete, you might want to consider a practice that has firsthand experience with biomechanics  as textbook knowledge might not be enough.'),(3989,302,5,'Been here several times for a couple different issues, and it\'s been pretty great.

Take care of it right away with a specialist.So here\'s the thing to people shopping for a podiatristI\'ve always thought that you needed a referral. However, all you need to do here is go to their website and fill out their new patient forms. Then, they will verify your insurance beforehand and call you for an appointment the same day in my case. Because I have PPO insurance, I\'m covered here. My story started 5 months ago from a bad pedicure. I felt some discomfort later that night but I waited until after my ski trip to get it checked out somewhere else. A round of antibiotics was prescribed to me and some cream but 5 months later, although it was better, it was still clearly swollen; anyone who stepped on my left big toe would have received a punch in the face. Luckily, no punches have been given. FDFAC was able to get me in the same day after I sent in my insurance forms first thing in the morning. Unfortunately, I wasn\'t available until the day after. I arrived at my appointment on time; I was taken in immediately. Anthony Nguyen and his assistant came in. Anthony took one look at it and told me the only way my toe was going to fully heal was removing the ingrown nail. I asked him when we could get this done, and he said, Today... as soon as possible whenever you\'re free.So I proceeded to sit back while they stuck a needle to numb my toe and remove the nail. Anthony and his assistant were very cool, talking to me as I stared at the ceiling. After the procedure, they informed me of my duties and even agreed to see me a day early for my followup since I was going on a tropical vacation.I\'m now looking forward to a toeinfectionfree tropical vacation.PS. Why the 5 months? Time flies when you\'re having fun. I told myself, no pain no gain but this probably wasn\'t the right situation for that.

It was obvious that he would take all the time necessary to help me feel as comfortable as possible about my condition. He has a great bedside manor. For these reasons in addition to his advanced skill set and experience I decided to have Dr. Nguyen perform the surgeries. It was discovered my problem was much more than the fracture and ligaments. I needed full reconstruction of my tendons and much more on both my R and L. I am in week 7 post operation of my left ankle. He was amazing for surgery and his entire office staff has been nothing short of amazing as well. Dr. Nguyen makes himself available for contact if you need anything which is not commom amongst doctors these days. You just call and he gets back to you even on the weekends if you have any concerns or issues. I plan on having him do the repair on my right ankle before the end of the year.

I would be absolutely appalled to see my information strewn around in such a matter and am surprised no one has launched a complaint to the California Medical Board. Reason 2: Degradation of clientsYes some people can be out of line, but as a medical professional and an individual trying to gain clientele, you should never belittle people I.e negative comments about job titles. Learn and grow from the criticism. Making snide remarks does little for your reputation, especially when it has nothing to do with the matter at hand.Reason 3: Did not feel the intake process justified my diagnosis. There are way too many people being told they have a sinus infection without due diligence.To summarize the yelp reviews: Jim is a knowledgable and conversational doctor with great business hours.However, listening to the patient\'s concerns, bedside manner, and the ability to take constructive criticism are areas that could use further development.If you\'re in need of timely service and a thorough doctor One Medical Group is an absolute blessing.'),(4019,303,5,'Dr Savage was great.

Please make me take hundreds of dollars worth of useless tests that you knew I was paying for outofpocket, make me suffer with a different disease because of your sloppy diagnosis, then tell me to chill out. You didn\'t just break a mug or step on my toe, Dr. Savage, you wasted my money and were careless about my health. Chill out is not the right response.I called him ten times in that case and if I never talked to him once, it is because he did not call me back. I called him recently to ask about a heart condition that he mentioned in passing during my original horrible experience with him. I just needed the name of this condition. Instead I had to call another ten times. Each time they said they would call back, and NONE of the times they did. They said they would email me a medical release form so I could have my current doctor read the three words off the chart. They did not. This was a question that should have taken 45 seconds to answer, instead it was dragged out for 3 days. Apparently, by the time he took a look at my chart he managed to discover my illness in a matter of minutes, with just the information he originally had during the first visit. WHY he didn\'t tell me at the time and order the tests AT THE TIME is beyond me. I have no idea why I had to suffer for two months before I saw another doctor who rightly diagnosed me when Jim Savage had all the information he needed during that first visit. Instead he just ordered all the wrong tests for the wrong diseases.

After getting lectured for taking 2 vicodin that day I could barely walk, he preceded to inform me the real problem was that I\'m too tall to be running and I need tendon therapy.

I\'ve seen Dr Savage a handful of times. I saw him mostly for last minute visits because I am often really busy with work. All of the yelp reviews I read prior to going were around surprise bills. I had never experienced one. I even recommended my employees and friends to see Dr. Savage when they were ill. I am now extremely embarrassed that I recommended him for fear that they will probably go through the same experience. I will have to go back and take back my recommendation and warn them to stay away. The past 2 weeks I\'ve been dealing with a NIGHTMARE. I have been trying to sort out a surprise large bill and dealing with a rude billing person who has threatened to send me to collections. Interestingly enough, I\'ve been trying to take care of the bill and at no point have I suggested that I would not pay. I am simply trying to understand what these charges are for. Some of these charges are from months ago so I called in to ask for a more detailed bill and she refused to send me something more detailed. Instead she condescendingly tried to explain how deductibles work. I understand how they work, I wasn\'t asking for an explanation. All i wanted was to understand what these vists were for since they are from several months ago. I also wanted to make sure nothing had been miscategorized, as I have read several reviews on here that suggest they often make miscategorization mistakes.  She said that she would not be sending me any details and was just going to send me to collections.  I would never have her interfacing with customers of my business. She claims that they had been sending bills to my home for a while. However, I never received any bills prior to her sending one bill to my office address when i asked her to.  After being THREATENED and VERBALLY ABUSED by her. I asked to speak to the DR because she was being extremely rude and belittling. She refused to let me speak to him or even leave a message for him to call me back. If i knew my employees were speaking to our customers that way, I would fire them. This is by far the worst customer service experience I have ever had. All of the posts below regarding surprise bills and horrible customer service are spot on.

Due to the funding, I could only choose the eye lid surgery. I was pleased with the result. 2013, after saving up the fund, I wanted to go for the nose job. I went back to his office to discuss some detail. I found out that the cost of my procedure addressing some problematic areas had gone up from $7K to $12K. I did some research and found $12K would probably be on the top range for my type of procedure anywhere in California. I understood the quote was only valid for 90 days so I had to rethink about my finance and needed more time to save up my fund.In 2014 May, after saving up $12K, I decided to go for the procedure and I was still interested in having Dr. Chow to do it for me. I visited him trying to finalize all detail  shape, length, risk..etc. After the visit, I got a quote from his new office manager  $17,000. I was speechless!!

I called the manager expressing my deep concerns and disappointment questioning why such jump in cost. The manager agreed to look into this matter for me.

Several areas were not included. I told her that I had addressed these areas with Dr. Chow since my first visit in 2012. I don\'t think this answer can justify it. I have never heard anything like this from a medical facility or any businesses. I simply can not justify the increased spending for my part because someone in his office made a mistake. It is simply unacceptable. I wished that the office could just honor the quotes offered to its customers especially to its existing patients.

As the nurse said we got to play I was able to try different size implants on with different style bras and different style shirts to have a really good idea of how the breasts would look after surgery. Both the nurse and Dr. Chow were very patient and took the extra time to explain everything to me. I had 2 pages worth of questions written down and by time it was toward the end of the consult I only had 2 questions because every single question was answered during the consult.

I appreciated their honestly. I was considering doing liposuction to the sides of the breast during the same surgery as the implants being placed. Dr. Chow discussed the increased risks associated with having both of those procedures done in one surgery. Usually medical providers are in a rush to get you in and out of their office.

Two years ago, I broke my nose going up for a header in my college soccer game. After getting looked at by my university\'s doctors, they ultimately referred me to a more specialized doctor in Davis since I complained of being unable to breath. While there, I was lucky enough to get a last minute appointment with Dr. Chow who had the cuttingedge technology to look in my nose. Using his advanced endoscope, he was able to clearly see the damage of not only my left septum but also the damage done to my right septum. Unlike the doctors at my university who told me I was cleared to play with no broken nose, Dr. Chow identified both my broken nose and deviated septum. Through out the entire consultation process, Dr. Chow was more than supportive in making sure my nose was adjusted correctly. He reassured me that the surgery would run smoothly by describing the surgical procedure step by step; hence, I had complete trust in him.Once in the surgery room, Dr. Chow fully realized the scale of the damage done to my nose. Instead of rushing to finish the surgery in the scheduled amount of time, Dr. Chow took the time needed to make my nose perfect. Ultimately, the surgery was a great success. I am more than happy with the results and deeply appreciate all the hard work, time and consideration Dr. Chow put in adjusting my nose.Unfortunately, my story does not stop here. A couple months ago, I was again playing soccer at a BBQ when my friend unintentionally kicked the soccer ball at my face, breaking my nose. Needless to say I was beyond upset. I was not just devastated to have to live through the recovery process of nasal surgery again, but I was dreading seeing the reaction of Dr. Chow. He spent so much time on perfecting my nose the first time that I knew he would not want to hear this news. When I called his office and explained to them that I broke my nose again, Dr. Chow immediately scheduled me to see him. A week later, Dr. Chow performed surgery on my nose for a second time. Again, he did an absolutely amazing job taking the time to make my nose look it\'s very best. I honestly cannot say enough kind remarks about Dr. Chow.

The recovery process was surprisingly painless; I only took pain medication the first 24 hours after the surgery. My nose looks quite natural, and some people cannot believe that I ever had plastic surgery because of the fantastic job Dr. Chow did. Those that did notice have told me how great it looks, and I have referred a couple of friends to Dr. Chow. I am personally thrilled with how it looks and the two tiny exterior incisions that he made have left absolutely no scarring. Most of the time, I forget I even had surgery.

He was able to cut out the stretched out skin from my nostrils and also take cartilage from my ear n use it for the bottom of my nose. The results were great. My nose looks natural. He also made me feel very comfortable when asking questions. I highly recommend him.'),(4058,304,5,'I\'ve spent many years pondering plastic surgery and interviewing for the best surgeon I had looked into probably about 1520 surgeons across the country, and I have to say Dr. Chow has far exceeded expectations in all fronts: his superb credentials UC Berkeley, UCSF, level of experience don\'t let his youthful appearance fool you as it did for me initially, talent as a doctor and surgeon, the painstaking detail and artistry he puts into his work, congenial bedside manner, and rarely might you hear this in combination with those listed above... reasonable price point.I was surprised to see relatively fewer Yelp reviews for him, given what an amazing plastic surgeon he is. When I asked him about it, he said he usually takes those things with a grain of salt. I believe he focuses all his energy on ensuring the highest quality of medical care to each of his patients rather than allocating any of his time to selfpromotion and advertising to simply pump up patient volume which can be timely and expensive for doctors who choose to pursue that route, often translating to lower quality, more expensive care for the consumer. He\'s also extremely modest  if I hadn\'t looked more closely into his credentials, which he didn\'t mention during our consultation  I would have totally overlooked him. While many practice\'s websites I looked at touted in capital letters at the top BOARDCERTIFIED, or even DOUBLE board certified, Dr. Chow is TRIPLE board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, American Board of Facial Plastic Surgery, and Board of Head and Neck as well as a member with the American Society of Plastic Surgery, which he mentions quite inconspicuously at the bottom of his website. Now, I\'ve looked at a lot of doctors, and very rarely have I seen all four of these credentials. You have to be a very talented doctor to be able to achieve all that. To further demonstrate his focus on quality rather than quantity, I remember I spoke with another doctor and I asked him how long a rhinoplasty would take, and he said with his years of experience, he could bang it out in about an hour. Forgive me, but this is my face we\'re talking about... I don\'t care if you\'re worldrenowned and have performed thousands of rhinoplasties, I want my surgeon to take all the time necessary to ensure that my expectations are met. And that is what Dr. Chow did. We\'ve spent many consultations discussing rhinoplasty so he knew how particular I was about it  in surgery, he spent FIVE hours to painstaking detail on my nose alone and I am thrilled with the results. He didn\'t even charge me for the overtime in the operating room! Also about Dr. Chow: he can do CLOSED rhinoplasties. This is very difficult and requires a high degree of skill and dexterity of surgical hands. Very few plastic surgeons are capable of doing this well  they usually only can do open rhinoplasties, which as you can imagine, causes more bruising, scarring, and requires longer recovery time. With a closed rhinoplasty, there is absolutely no external scarring. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that Dr. Chow charged less for his closed rhinoplasties than most doctors who can only do open rhinos. The other great thing about Dr. Chow is that he doesn\'t charge consultation fees like many other doctors. I met with him three or four times over the length of about 810 months before finally deciding to have the surgery, all without being charged a penny. He will meet with you as many times as you need to get comfortable. And I never felt pressured to commit to surgery with him  he even encouraged me to take a couple more months to think about exactly what I wanted. I\'m a very particular customer, so every time I went in, I usually had a list of about 1020 questions, which he always answered patiently, never making me feel rushed or like I was wasting his time. With our healthcare system in desperate need of a makeover, it\'s such a rare pleasure to find a doctor with the priorities of Dr. Chow. It was apparent to me through our interactions over time that he is genuinely passionate about medicine and helping his patients feel better about their appearance, and that monetary reward is tertiary. His staff, especially Cassandra, is also warm and fantastic. When I didn\'t have a ride home after the surgery, she offered to give me one. Little did I know that this was a much bigger favor than it seemed. After the surgery, she had to wait in the office until about 10pm while I spent several hours recovering from the anesthesia, which she did happily Here\'s some advice I\'d like to share if you decide to meet with a plastic surgeon:  Bring pictures of yourself so you can specify what you may not like Pictures of friends or celebrities demonstrating your ideal, helping Dr. Chow understand your standard of beauty  Do your research  Speak to former patients'),(4059,304,5,'Two years, eight doctors and seven consults later, I finally decided on booking my breast augmentation with Dr. Chow.I am so beyond happy, that my only regret is not having surgery earlier.I had consult appointments with every reputable surgeon in San Francisco, a few in Marin County, and even considered going down to Los Angeles, because choosing the right surgeon was crucial for me that I literally obsessed over it for almost two years. Dr. Chow is TRIPLE board certified. Those are some pretty amazing qualifications. Not only that, but this man is so nice and met with me three times before I even booked my surgery with him. I had a million questions, and he answered all of them. I had a friend who had her breast augmentation with Dr. Chow and it was exactly what I wanted. I was fortunate enough to see her results before I took the plunge. I now LOVE how I look! Completely natural, perfect boobs. Granted, I\'m still in the beginning process of healing, but I could not be more pleased. The office staff Georgina, Debbie are awesome.... Anytime I have a silly question, I don\'t feel weird about calling and asking them. They don\'t ever make me feel rushed.So thrilled. Thanks, team!'),(4060,304,5,'Dr. Chow and his staff have been nothing but friendly, professional, and helpful through my entire prossess. Dr. Chow is an artist at what he does, and I am so happy I chose him. His staff even got my insurance to pay for 70% of my procedure, when I didn\'t think it was possible. I can\'t understand the prior review, because there has never once been any demands made on me before during or after my proceedure. I have never been so happy with a surgeon or his staff.'),(4061,304,5,'Dr . Chow was recommended to me by my OBGYN. One of my old breast implants was hardening and changing shape. In addition to that, my old implants were just too big. And due to the sizeweight of them, they took on a look of two rocks in a sock. I didn\'t like what was happening. Because I have had this procedure done before, I wanted to do my homework before seeing just any doctor. I went back to my original doctor and also received consultations by two other doctors. All of which didn\'t seem as down to earth as Dr. Chow. After seeing Dr Chow, and receiving a new augmentation and lift, I am not only the size that looks and feels great on me, but my girls are pointing in the right direction. I am very confident that when the time comes for my eye area to be treated, it will be Dr Chow that I will go to.'),(4062,304,5,'I have been going to Dr. Chow for over a year now. He has fixed my wrinkly forehead deep worry lines and somewhat droopy eye lid.  My friends think I look great as I just turned 50. The office staff is not only friendly and courteous, they truly make me feel at home. Dr. Chow and team are awesome.'),(4063,304,5,'I went in a few weeks ago for a breast augmentation consultation. It was an excellent experience. Dr. chow expresses full knowledge and confidence in his work, and explains details very well. His assistant explained and tested all the sizes for an hour and a half with me as we went back and forth trying to decide. it was a very comfortable and helpful appointment. After learning all of the details and choosing the perfect size, she went to the front and wrote up a full detailed statement of the costs, surgery dates available, the deposit needed to hold the surgery date, and wrote down the size information. As of now, i will be having my surgery October 10th, getting 375 CC silicone gel implants. The surgery hold was $1250, and the anaesthesia payment on the day of will be $700. All in all the surgery will be $6800 and i couldn\'t be more excited! also what i like is that he has a preop appointment to discuss any questions, mails a presurgery packet, and has different blood tests done beforehand. i\'ll post an update after the fact, i\'m sure i\'ll be overjoyed with the results!!'),(4064,304,5,'This is my second review for Dr Chow. I had brow surgery 18 months ago and was thrilled. I has liposuction this past May and every single day I am glad I did it and that Dr Chow was my doctor. This surgery changed my life. If you are considering liposuction do it, don\'t wait! I wish I\'d done this 20 years ago. Dr Chow is a technically gifted surgeon with a great bedside manner. He LISTENS closely and he is very generous with his time. He has an ability to make procedures look very natural and he will be honest with you about the what can or cannot be accomplished by the surgery. I have seen him for Botox and fillers as well. I am an esthetician and though many other docs try to entice me to refer them I simply don\'t do it. A referral is an extention of my business and Dr chow is the only plastic surgeon I would ever send my clients to see.'),(4065,304,5,'Seriously, fat is what we all want to get rid of, right?  Dr. Albert Chow has a better idea. He harvests that stuff from your tummy and uses it to fill in those divots you dislike around your mouth, under your eyes and along the nasal labia. It makes such great sense. It\'s your fat. You won\'t reject it and it should last a lot longer than synthetic fillers . He performed this procedure and a mini lift, smoothing the jowls and allowing me to stop wearing turtle neck tops. I visited three surgeons before choosing him. I\'m thrilled with my choice. He is extremely generous with his time. His staff is warm and accommodating, and, most importantly, he is extremely talented in the art of natural results. I\'m in my mid 70s and when people gasp, I hand them Dr. Chow\'s card. Oh, not that it is the deciding factor, but his fees are very fair, compared with the other drs.  BTW, when I  left their offices clutching the laundry list of procedures they recommended, I felt like Grandma Moses. After my first visit with Dr. Chow, I had a totally different experience. I was anxious to get on with his recommendations to freshen up. I did and I\'m very pleased.'),(4066,304,5,'I decided to visit Dr. Chow in part based on the helpful reviews of other Yelpers. I would love to return the favor and now share my great experience with him.Dr. Chow is hands down one of the very best doctors I have ever had. Although I am still waiting for the full results of my procedure to develop, I have been nothing less than thrilled with the level of care I have received. I think I was most impressed with how much time Dr. Chow took to understand what I wanted, answer all my questions, and evaluate how my procedure fixing a deviated septum plus rhinoplasty fit into my overall health needs.  He helped me evaluate a few different options and choose what felt best for me. He clearly was willing to take a significant amount of time and energy upfront to ensure I was going to be happy with my end results. I did an enormous amount of research into different doctors in the Bay Area before choosing Dr. Chow and he clearly stood out based on his education, experience, and happy former patients. I was also impressed by the fact that he called my family immediately after I got out of surgery to let them know I was okay, a simple but very nice touch. It was the first experience I have had with a doctor where I felt like a person not just a patient.  The rest of his staff is a pure delight to work with. Cassandra is absolutely wonderful, the perfect blend of a comforting friend and efficientknowledgeable nurse. She made what could have been a stressful day of surgery amazingly smooth. The entire staff welcomes your questions and quickly gets back to you with answers. Overall I was nothing but thrilled with the experience.'),(4067,305,5,'Dr. Sloan helped me in my tonsillectomy through and through. Highly recommended. I had never had any serious health complications so was very worried at some recurring throat problems. When we discussed the S word, he never pressured me either way, instead letting me decide what I felt what was needed. If you have any questions, speak up and he will answer them. The surgery went swimmingly and he was there for me during two weeks of a tough recovery. Phone calls every few days. A prompt followup appointment. Very kind and professional. Obviously he\'s a busy man, but he never lets it really show. Thanks Dr. Sloan for healing my awful throat!'),(4068,305,1,'Highly recommend trying someone else. He doesn\'t walk you through anything or set expectations. Both times I felt run out of the office.  I had very specific questions my second visit after the same problem came back and when I asked basic questions he talked back to me in a descending way. Are you going to make incisions to drain both areas of the swelling to which he said in a descending voice  of course, you think i would just do one? I learned my lesson from not speaking up the first visit and asking if any other issues could arise. But when I get home from the second visit and come evening the novacaine wears off and I\'m in serious pain. Thinking something is wrong bc he didn\'t mention I\'d have any pain or severe swelling and throbbing pain. When I called concerned at this his reply was what I\'m experiencing is not surprising at all. Really? Why didnt you explain and let me know before. Your responsibility as a doctor is to advise your patients which for some reason he feels is unnecessary.  As stated in the other reviews he makes you wait over an hour in the room before seeing you. Twice came in started working and then left to see other patients only to come back without saying anything 20 minutes later. He even took a phone call as he was cutting open my ear! He tried to be super friendly and call me champ, buddy but it is all super ungenuine when you never built any rapport. Its wasn\'t just a lack of bedside presence but also his decision and technical ability was very much in question. After giving him several attempts for him to fix the issue that was happening I decided to go to another doctor as I had lost all patience and any small amount of trust for him.'),(4069,305,5,'I saw Dr. Sloan today as I have had an onset of tinnitus...constant echoing in one ear.

Not only did he do excellent sinus surgery for me in 1999 which resolved my horrible sinus symptoms, but he also saw me on the weekend in follow up, AND I got a scan in 2014 and all sinuses remain clear! Of course I have allergies but nothing like I had before surgery. He IS a very busy doctor but aims for perfection, exactly who I would want working on me!

I continue to see him for all my ENT concerns and so does my husband'),(4071,305,1,'Very disappointed. Appt was waste of time and money. Dr Sloan was short and dismissive of my symptoms.

Really?!?!?!'),(4072,305,5,'Dr. Steven Sloan performed my surgery last month. Though it was a painful recovery I\'m glad I had it done. He basically shaved my uvula punching bag, removed my tonsils and worked on the inferior nasal turbinate to minimize obstruction. I had a sleep study and it revealed that I stopped breathing, had restless leg syndrome and snored. I also have acid reflux and would wake up choking in my sleep due to the acid. He assured me that this surgery would help me considerably versus getting the Cpap machine which blows O2 into your passageways. I travel abroad every year and I would hate to carry a machine through the airport, just a big hassle. I\'m so happy now. I breathe better, but most importantly I sleep better. It was so bad that I would average just a few hours of sleep a day. Now I have vivid dreams and get the morning woody. It\'s amazing what Dr. Sloan did for me. He almost guaranteed me this surgery would benefit me and it did immensely. I\'m diabetic and have high blood pressure so the thought of me continuing this lifestyle of no sleep was literally setting me up for a stroke or heart attack. I\'m forever grateful to Dr. Sloan. He would call me regularly to see how I was doing and if I needed anything during my recovery. He treated me with such respect and care you couldn\'t ask for more unless you\'re a child, lol. I highly recommend Dr. Sloan if you have any of the symptoms I had. His office manager Caroline is also a huge asset to his practice. She was amazing in helping me schedule my procedure that best worked for my work schedule. This is a come and go procedure. However, the recovery is a good two weeks. She definitely provided me with excellent customer service at all times. Thank you Dr. Sloan and Caroline for everything you did for me.'),(4073,305,5,'Dr. Sloan is the best ENT!

He then calls or texts me a week after seeing me just to make sure the antibiotics are working. He truly care about each individual patient.

I met Dr. Sloan on a Sunday on his day off! in the lobby of a hospital because I was stricken by shingles in the ear over the weekend that led to facial paralysis on the leftside of my face  a rare condition called Ramsay Hunt. Dr. Sloan is the best combination of a personal caring doctor with solid, practical medical advice. At the outset and throughout my condition, which has now fully healed, Dr. Sloan realized I needed personal attention, so he took his own personal time to meet with me, give me a full consultation, answer any questions I had, and, mainly, reassure me it was going to be a smooth, speedy recovery because I knew I had him in my corner. In the initial consultation where we met in a hospital lobby, he walked me into the hospital to show me how to properly tape up my left eyelid shut as the virus prevented my left eye from blinking or closing. My primary care doctor & ER doctor just recommended I use an eye patch to sleep with at nighttime, but an eye patch could scratch the cornea and eye. The taping method that Dr. Sloan took the time to show me and advise me about may have protected my lefteye over this monthlong period, as well as longtermmy lifetime! He also changed my dosage of steroids in this consultation and I believe this contributed to my full nerve regeneration and recovery. [Believe it or not, I never received a bill for this meeting.]In the office visits, Dr. Sloan was a careful and patient doctorENT and he made sure to assess any potential risks with my hearing, eye sight, and assess all options to get to a full recovery. He also gave me a personal recommendation to a hardtoreach UCSF doctor that he knew personally thank you!. It was also funny to see the photos of the famous people he took care of Steve Tyler in his office.

I don\'t mind waiting if he\'s a good doctor both visits about 45min to an hour wait, but the first visit was a nightmare. He was OK friendly at the beginning, but whenever I asked him a question, he told me to just read the brochure he gave me. I didn\'t see him sanitize his equipments when he checked the inside of my nose. But the worst part is, he stuck a giant needle into my nostril without any warning!!! As you could imagine how painful it was, he did it twice since he didn\'t do it well the first time! I could feel him pushing the needle as far as he could into the bonebottom of my nostril. I was so in pain and tear just came down like water fall. After that, he made me tape a giant piece of gauze across my face for the next few days. I looked like I had plastic surgery done.He required me to go back 2 days later for check up. My mom insisted to come with me, knowing how horrible my experience was last time. He checked my nose, bleeding seemed to stop that\'s why I have to credit him with one star, and he gave me a small bottle of saline nasal spray sample to take home. He showed me how to use it by squeezing the bottle, towards me, onto my shirt and pants! Both my mom and I were shocked.

Dr. Sloan is no nonsense, he properly diagnoses, tests, explains what\'s going on and what will happen using photos, graphs, and CT scan results, and he explains the procedure and expected recovery time.

I was a good candidate for a septoplasty and turbinate reduction that promised a lifetime of clearer breathing.

Dr. Sloan multitasks when it comes to seeing patients; I think he books two, maybe three patients at the same time slot and bounces between them.

Dr. Sloan is no Orin Scrivello D.D.S. by any means. I just think there\'s no way to make the act of pulling out bloodsoaked gauze from deep inside your schnoz holes painless, so you\'d better have your big boy pants on.

I grossly underestimated how I\'d feel during recovery. It. Sucked. Recovery was slow, long, and uncomfortable. But now, two months postop, what a f*****g difference! Dr. Sloan is a skilled surgeon. I can now shoot snot rockets midrun or midworkout out of BOTH nostrils, whereas the left side used to just produce a wad of oozy snot that I had to wipe away quickly before it dripped down passed my upper lip rim and into my mouth.

Yuck right, I\'ve never said boo cause I know it is a closed system and I should just tough it out.'),(4098,305,1,'I was referred to Dr. Sloan and was excited to finally see a specialist for some jaw issues that were causing me intense pain. I arrived early and was told to wait. Someone else came after me with a later appointment time, and for some reason she was seen before me. I ended up waiting over an hour for him to visit me for basically thirty seconds at a time, always running out to check on other patients. In the end, it was a great waste of time because he didn\'t help me at all. He just gave me a bunch of pamphlets and sent me on my way.Before I left I paid what they told me was my copay $10 but a few weeks later I got a bill for $260. My insurance companyschool nursesomeone else thankfully settled this for me, but it took them months and I received several past due notices from the office.Dr. Sloan was not warm or caring like the other reviews suggested.

Thank you Dr. Sloan!'),(4100,305,2,'I have been to Dr. Sloan\'s office several time in the past two years and for the most part, he is a considerate and kind doctor. However, I am compelled to write this review today, shortly after leaving his office, for his rude and unprofessional behavior with me.Today, Dr. Sloan walks into the room 30 minutes late as usual and greets me with his vibrant welcome. He asks me wether I have been taking my medication he prescribed me last month for acid reflux and abruptly and I mean abruptly, gets incredibly agitated and annoyed when I said I have not. He automatically assumed that my current throat problem possible strep was a result of not taking the medication he prescribed me. When I told him that was not the case, he hesitantly calmed down and proceeded to examine me.He, a little aggressively, checked my throat with the wooden stick and sprayed an incredibly large quantity of some type of disinfectant fluid into my nose. He then began to lecture me about how he has no time for small issues like mine and that next time, he would not take me without a primary doctor\'s approval first. Fine  We all wake up on the wrong side of the pillow sometimes.He then, while still lecturing me like i\'m a kid, opens the door so now all the patients outside could hear. He continued on for a couple more seconds and left abruptly without saying a word. So I sat there, confused as a duck and time ticked by. After 10 minutes, I presumed that he was done with my checkup and decided to leave only to find out, after an assistant had asked him, that he was far from finishing my exam. I waited 5 more minutes and decided to leave only to run into him in the hallway. I told him I had to run to class and that I would be back next time if the issue persisted. He, with a mix of pity and guilt, asked me if I was feeling alright now as if he had cured me by spraying some fluid into my nose. I said my farewell and left his office with $25 dollars less in my pocket, 1 hour of my time wasted, an unfinished exam, and a persistent sore throat.It\'s a shame to have an experience like this with a doctor I respected. I don\'t know what was his situation but that form of rude and disrespectful attitude does not vibrate with me. I have nothing personal against the man but that is no way to treat a sick patient. Charles J'),(4101,305,5,'I have not been able to fully breathe out of my nose my whole life. My sense of smell has gone to hell, and I always have sinus pressure. After reading some reviews, I payed Dr. Sloan a visit. He is very friendly, and straightforward. The thing that is sometimes scary is that he will do things, then halfway into what he is doing, he will tell you what he is doing. Haha. This was kind of scary the first time. For example, he stuck a camera in my nose and did not tell me. Touche. Anyways, he diagnosed me with polyps. I had a blockage in my nose preventing me from breathing, and even smelling. He said that surgery was an option. However, he wanted to put me on some nasal spray to see if it would shrink. And it did : . Now, I can smell 70% better and I can breathe. Everytime I come here, I feel so alive after. Every visit, he flushes out my ears, and shoots some intense nasal spray up my nose. It feels awesome afterwards. Great doctor.

He\'s smart, he\'s wellversed, he\'s updated on the latest research and procedures, he doesn\'t talk down to you, and he\'s always a delight to catch up with when I do see him.Yes, the waits can sometimes run long  up to a halfhour at times. Office management can certainly be better than this. But what doctor\'s office with top quality care cranks through patients like factory clockwork? Good health care isn\'t like fast food. If I have to wait a little longer because I know he will be able to spend more focused time on my care and questions, it\'s a reasonable tradeoff.The office\'s time management keeps him from a 5star rating, but that is a fair assessment. It\'s certainly a more rational rating than the numerous 5star or 1star only reviews from manic depressives here and elsewhere throughout Yelp.'),(4103,305,1,'I was left waiting for almost 30 min in the exam room  after waiting over an hour in the waiting room.

He popped it back into place, which was a little unsettling, but it was really quick and only cost me $3540 with insurance.

After examining my sinuses, he said I had a moderate to severe deviation in my septum. He said there\'s a very simple procedure for it that would help me breathe better. If I was interested, I should get back in touch with him after 23 months to let my nose heal and come back in to check it out. I was thankful that he was informative about the procedure, while not making me feel pressured to have it.I came back after a few months and he checked out my septum again. He referred to get a CT scan. When I came back to check over the results, he again recommended a surgery to fix my septum. In the scan it was very easy to see the deviation and why I had trouble breathing.I scheduled the procedure at St. Mary\'s. The experience there was fine, and the surgery went really well. I was back home about 2 hours after the procedure. I felt pretty miserable the next two days because of the packing up my nostrils.When I came in to get the packing removed I was amazed at how easy it was to breathe!

When visiting my sister in San Carlos one of her two small dogs bit my daughter in the face. I was able to calm her down and discussed what to do but as we were leaving for Sacramento that afternoon and the bleeding had stopped I decided to hold off and go to a clinic in Sacramento. That evening we went to a clinic and the doctor suggested we go to an emergency room where there might be a plastics doc to stitch her up with the least amount of future scarring. We went to a Sacramento ER and after waiting an hour and then being told that it could be another 34 or more we went back to my friends house. Next day my sister was able to get me is an appointment with Dr. ransom for that afternoon! Had we called the day before he probably would have taken us then but I guess my sister didn\'t think of it. Anyway, long story short maybe already too late!

She has just a tiny little scar that I pretty much am the only one that can noticed and she\'s not afraid of dogs! I credit Dr. Ransom and his wonderful team for this. Highly recommend this professional, skilled, friendly and compassionate team. Wish I could post before and after pics.'),(4110,306,5,'I followed the reviews here as well as the reviews on realself.com, and my fellow reviewers are absolutely right  Dr. Ransom is THE BEST! I am SO happy with his work. I came to Dr. Ransom 3 days after I got Restylane injections in the tear troughs from a very terrible dermatologist here in SF see my 1 star review on Yelp, where I paid $618 and saw no difference whatsoever after using 1 full syringe. Now, let me tell you how wonderful Dr. Ransom\'s office is. First, they really work with you to try to fit you in ASAP. They are also very fast and responsive via email communication, as well as returning phone calls. The office coordinator, Dee, is very friendly and super helpful. The best thing about Deethe office is that they try to get you discounts from manufacturers i.e., they let you know about deals that you can sign up for and get coupons, so you can save quite a bit of money depending on the procedure you get, I guess. Don\'t quote me; this was just my personal experience. I thought this was really great because Dee has to go out of her way in her busy day to get some paperwork done for you e.g., certify that you got the procedures, when shethe office really doesn\'t have to. Because being costeffective while not sacrificing quality is very important to me, I\'m very thankful for this.  Now, onto Dr. Ransom. My first appointment was a consultation consultation fee applied towards procedure if you decide to get the procedure. Dr. Ransom was extremely friendly, kind, and personable. He takes his time to thoroughly explain the procedures, the mechanisms, even in scientific terms if you\'re interested, and treats you like you are intelligent and a valued customer. He doesn\'t try to dumb things down for you, rush you through the appointment, or give false information unlike the terrible dermatologist I went to. He tells you things honestly, asis, and does not try to sell you additional services or try to get you to spend more money than you need to some bad doctors will try to get you to buy an additional syringe or add on Botox when they\'re the ones who are incompetent and failed to do their job correctly. Even when I suggested that I\'m interested in a particularadditional procedure, he\'d tell me that I don\'t need it. So, Dr. Ransom is definitely a very trustworthy and ethical doctor. He also has wonderful bedside manners, as many others have said.I know a lot of the reviews here are for surgical procedures, but I want to add that Dr. Ransom is excellent at injections as well. I came here to get a second opinion and also to fix the work of the previous doctor. I wanted to minimize the appearance of my under eye bags and dark circles. Dr. Ransom first used an enzyme to dissolve the poor work that the previous doctor did, and then I got 1 syringe total of Restylane injected in the tear troughs. Dr. Ransom is very meticulous. He took the time to carefully mark the areas for injections whereas the bad doctor I saw previously just eyeballed it. Dr. Ransom definitely took his time and made sure everything was clean and perfectly set before he did the injections. He numbed the area beforehand as well, so the pain was very minimal during the injections.He also uses the microcannula needle, which is preferable to the regular needle, because it is less painful, more precise ?, and causes less bruising. The procedure was so much less painful when it\'s done by Dr. Ransom than by the other doctor. The bruising was also far less as well. The best part? The results. I love the results! No more dark circleseye bags with just 1 syringe injected by Dr. Ransom whereas the previous doctor\'s method didn\'t work, and she tried to get me to buy more. There is a huge, noticeable improvement in my under eye appearance, and it was noticeable right away. Dr. Ransom had told me that he could not make the dark circleseye bags go away completely, but in fact he did! I no longer see them and I feel so much more confident and happier. I\'m so glad that I had chosen Dr. Ransom to perform the work. Whenever this Restylane fades, I will definitely come back to Dr. Ransom for subsequent injections. I highly recommend Dr. Ransom for injectables. His prices are very good, and excellent after you use any available coupons. So, you get the best work at the best prices. I couldn\'t have asked for more and am 100% happy with my treatment process and my results. Side note: Dr. Ransom performs volunteer humanitarian work repairing cleft lips for children in third world countries. I find this to be a very admirable personal trait, on top of his excellent skills as a surgeon.

I went in to get Restylane injections in the tear troughs and couldn\'t be happier. Dr. Ransom marked exactly where he was going to inject and it was relatively quick and painless! He also used one full syringe on me, cautioning me that two syringes might be too much. I noticed results immediately! Still waiting for a little bit of the swelling to go down to see the full results but I will 100% be going back.Note: He also mentioned that he would have to take off my makeup under the eye for the fillers and wanted to make sure I brought some powder and stuff since I was going straight back to work. He didn\'t want the bruising to be as noticeable since I mentioned that I wanted to keep it hush hush! How sweet!

The operating room in his office building was very nice and the staff was lovely. Before deciding, I asked to speak to a couple of references, and the people I spoke to had had far more extensive work than I had. One of the former patients had a blood condition which would have made his surgery very tricky. Yet Dr Ransom was able to not not work around this problem, but he produced fantastic results. I saw this patient\'s photos and he looked at least 20 years younger. This particular patient had looked for a surgeon in several cities before deciding on Dr Ransom.

I had given Dr. Kong opportunity to make the situation right and to cover additional costs which do not account for time and suffering involved, but as she refused to as noted in a letter I received from her attorney, it seems she believes she treated me appropriately, which I believe is not the case. The Medical Board will decide the outcome as will the court if I decide to pursue a case, which I am currently considering.A word of advice to all: please get a thorough consultation and evaluation from any medical provider performing a cosmetic dermatology treatment, especially one who is not board certified by the Medical Board of Dermatology.

I see the Dr. for 510 minutes. I barely make it back to my car before my meter expires. OR...I have to go feed my meter another $2 or ask someone to go feed it for me.

Barely asking me a question, you took one look at it and told me it was an infection which surprised me. Why would an infection manifest in my knee, I wondered? But I took the medicine that you prescribed and then called you 4 or so days later to tell you that nothing had changed; I still had the huge, round rash centering on the inside of my knee and extending at least 10 inches out on my leg. I remember you expressing surprise and then prescribing yet another antibiotic to me. I so wish at that point it had dawned on you that you had made a mistake in your determination and that you had thought to ask me back in to take a second look and seriously reconsider your first response to my symptoms. As you know from my phone call to you in 2006, I have lyme disease. That rash was the result of a tick bite. Sadly, neither of us knew. Since my appointment with you, I have had serious neural problems such as frequent migraines and have twice lost my ability to speak. I have also had 4 crowns, a root canal and a tooth extraction. I have arthritis and tinnitus. I have spent tens of thousands of dollars dealing with my health issues as well as losing weeks of my life being incapacitated by fatigue and migraines. I was fortunate enough to have found a osteopath who figured out what it was but that was a year and a half after I had seen you.Clearly there is nothing you can do for me at this point. But when I called you in 2006 to tell you with what I was diagnosed, the least you could have done was apologize. You do not appear to me to be a healer but rather a doctor. Few people can believe that you missed the bullseye rash that was on my leg. I chalk it up to you being a city doctor but had you been more thoughtful and less hurried perhaps you would have actually figured out what my symptoms meant. I often wonder if your flippant attitude towards me was because I was in between jobs and health insurance. I can only hope that I am the only person you have seen that has fallen through the cracks. But with each doctor or dentist appointment, I think back to our appointment and wish more than anything that you had known that the rash was a tick bite and had put me on doxycycline right away.

Again, I was told it was nothing to really worry about and I could get filler if I wanted to and it could eventually heal over time. BECAUSE THE MUSCLE AND FAT AT THE INJECTION SITE WAS ATROPHYING. It is a huge cause of alarm but really all I can do it watch it. I emailed again last week to ask if this is something I should be worried about as it\'s gotten deeper and darker. Research on the internet isn\'t pretty but as we all know the internet shows the worst of the worst. I haven\'t received any response. Health is such a vulnerable situation and skin issues are terrible. Especially chronic ones that need adjusting and different techniques to find the right one. I take the radio silence as a See ya, you didn\'t work out!I will be continuing my successful acupunture treatments and seeking out a primary care doctor to help figure this out.

My insurance is incredibly stingy about pharmaceutical coverage and he even tides me over with samples while we wait for my insurance to suck less.Also, I don\'t know why patients associate bedside manner with longwinded, drawnout appointments.

But I am so impressed with Dr.Resse that I am going to rewrite it all over again. Dr. Reese is definitely the BEST doctor I\'ve ever seen. Simply because of his bedside manners and easygoing but professional personality. This was my first time seeing a dermatologist and he put me right at ease as soon as he walked in the door. He\'s funny and is very informative. He is able to get a lot of information out in a timely manner and I truly appreciate that.

He is extremely nice and explains in details, which is make me comfortable, as I have a sensitive skin.

They deserve more than two. They were fine, did their jobs, polite, professional.tl;dr: Scroll down to ****But Dr. Hall, no. I was a bit concerned after reading reviews here but the good ones were REALLY good so I gave them a try. I had a few issues I wanted looked at, and I told the receptionist that when I made the appointment. She said it was fine to do it all in one appointment.I got there about 5 minutes early but had to wait almost 20. I really hate that when they tell you you will have to pay $75 for a no show because their time matters, but your time? Well, that\'s your problem.The nurse assistant don\'t know her title was polite, showed me to my room, talked to me a bit. Then I waited. Again. For a fair bit of time for the doctor. I told her I wanted a skin check for cancer, as skin cancer runs in my family and I do this annually, and I wanted to talk about a few other items. She did the check first and missed the two large areas my last two doctors immediately found and noted we should watch. I did not purposefully not point them out as some trick question, I just didn\'t think about it until she was done and said it all looked fine. She didn\'t even mention the two scars I have from previous biopsies. That didn\'t make me feel very safe.Then we talked about acne. She hardly listened  including to me saying the only thing that has worked in the past is one particular antibiotic  and just told me to use this type of soap that I mentioned made my skin rash up. She didn\'t listen at all. She made no mention of antibiotics, or a follow up, or trying a different routine. I tried to talk to her about a rash on my sides that appear from time to time. They weren\'t present for the appointment, of course, wily jerks, but I thought she might at least have insight if it\'s a common occurrence with people. She blew it off. Not, oh when they come back, make an appointment and we\'ll look. More of I don\'t give a rat\'s about my patients so I\'m not listening to anything. Give me your money and move on.But the best part, the crowning moment, was when I asked her if there was anything they could do about my neck. I was referring to a scar from a childhood tragedy that isn\'t super visible but it bothers me. She replied, You mean your chicken neck? ....**** You mean your chicken neck. ****I didn\'t know I had a chicken neck, but you know what I see in a mirror, to the point of tears, every time I look now? A chicken neck. Worst, it wasn\'t like she was trying to get me to feel insecure and have surgery, which is similarly deplorable, but at least there would be an explanation. She went on before I could interrupt to say nothing could be done. Oh your nasty, ugly body? No, we can\'t do anything about your nasty, ugly body! I bet the kids tease you a lot, you nasty, ugly woman. That\'s what I heard. When I flirt with men, I am convinced all they are looking at is my chicken neck. I am now considering talking to a specialist about my chicken neck... and I am not even sure it\'s there... She apologized and said, I shouldn\'t have said it that way. NOT HELPING. Honestly, what professional at her level would EVER say something like that to another human? Honestly, the bitchiest thing someone has ever said to my face. And I had an ex boyfriend that liked to tell me how fat I was and that no one would ever love me, but even he had more tact about it. Though the two are in a close running. Maybe I should introduce them. They could put each other down happily ever after...And for all that  poor acne treatment advice, not listening to other issues, missing abnormal moles on a skin check, and calling me names like a damn preschooler, I got to pay a premium.'),(4180,308,5,'I\'ve been seeing both Dr. Hall & Dr. Reese for a few years now, and I cannot say enough good things about their care & practice.

I had paid my $60 deductible, then Cigna paid for some of the visit and now I had another $152.59 that I owed. WAIT A MINUTE! I wasn\'t at all apprised of the cost of the visit, I didn\'t get to review the potential charges, no one said a thing about prices and now I\'m presented with this other bill? I am appalled at this whole thing. I run my own business and make a point of letting my clients know how much things are going to cost. Everything is agreed upon up front. BEFORE services are rendered. I guess that\'s not how things work in the healthcare industry. And I guess it was up to ME to find out all these figures rather than just relying on the Doctor or the office to apprise me.WORD TO THE WISE: ASK before getting any treatment done here. ASK!!!!

She did a great job with the surgery. The recovery was very easy, and I can already tell the scar is healing great.

He made us feel like he had all the time in the world to chat with me about my sleep issues, my sinus, my allergies, my snoring, and anything else on my mind.

Dr. Schindler took a conservative approach, avoiding anything invasive until it was absolutely essential; this saved me from at least one unnecessary needle. I found that he was also very commited to resolving my issues completely and always answered my questions patiently. On a lighter note Dr. Schindler is a closet foodie, just ask him about French Laundry to get the ball rolling :.

Just do it. I know whatever he is doing he has good reason. I completely trust this guy. You can always ask him afterwards and he\'ll definitely explain.

I didn\'t need a strategy consultant had advisors & mentors for that. Over time it became clear that what I really needed was someone to facilitate a deeper introspection and develop my interpersonal & leadership skills. Cameron does that.

The reviews from happier couples gave me hope and so we made an appointment.

I truly believe his mission is to get you in and out of there in a timely manner so you can get on with your life and live it to the fullest. I\'ve had therapists in the past that asked me how I felt like they were reading a psych 101 textbook. I\'ve had creepy crawlers threaten my boundaries. I\'ve had the overly sympathetic ones that crinkled their faces at the stories of my past and none of them ever helped me see a clear path from A to B as far as progress went.

Couples counseling has helped our relationship by teaching us to express our feelings effectively and to truly listen to one other without taking defense. The therapy sessions we have had with Cameron have really kept our marriage on the right track when we felt derailed. I am a very big believer in the process, I can not see how individuals and couples can get through life without ever seeing a therapist. They just help us to see where our issues stem from and how old patterns may be steering us in the wrong direction. My husband in particular has always trusted Cameron...which says a lot for a guy who watches a lot of sports and prefers to talk about soccer over his feelings. Those two guys share a great bond now which has helped my husband open up more during our sessions. I think Cameron has an ease with men which is a really great quality for this work.

Maya, for her part, was an insightful and compassionate ear for me.  She knew I was broken and needed an ally  many weeks it felt like she was my only friend.  Often I relied on the strength of my sessions with her to be able to face the challenges of the couples sessions and what was happening with the marriage.When we left California and continued couples therapy elsewhere, it became more apparent to me how much work in processing our grief we were able to do at The Well Clinic versus with others.  Ultimately, things deteriorated and communication became nearly impossible.  There is no way to know what would have happened with our marriage had we stayed in San Francisco and I continued to see Cameron and Maya, but I do know that I was on a great path with them.

They held me accountable, they didn\'t let me get away with anything something I\'d been very skilled at before, and they never gave up on me. Knowing them and liking them as people gave me the will and energy to work hard, to dig deep, and despite the difficulties, it was tremendously rewarding. They helped transform potentially sterile emotional pain into an opportunity for intense growth. It only ended because we moved away, but they got me to a better, more adult, and much more honest place.I can only speak for myself here, but my husband also saw Alex in individual sessions, and from what he told me, he feels very much the same way about him, too.

He found Cameron\'s care to be genuine, his expertise and perspective deeply valuable, and felt uniquely comfortable to open up to Cameron and let his guard down. He trusted Cameron completely. This in itself is an incredible endorsement, as Tom is not inclined to share feelings with people, was originally loathe to the concept of therapy and had to initially be dragged in. The dissolution of my relationship was an extremely painful, disorienting, and depleting time in my life, and Cameron\'s thoughtful, even, professional, caring manner served as a crucial, illuminating, and steady metronome for my head and my heart.

I highly regard him as a professional and as a person. He is genuinely kind, smart, balanced and highly professional.  He offers tools and doesn\'t have a directive style. Instead he listens and helps to restructure communication strategies so that each person feels better heard. What I found so impressive about him then, in his role as therapist and now still, is his combination of clinical and intuitive understanding of humans. He brings deep academic knowledge along with his ability to connect in a natural way with others to his work. Cameron often has a book to recommend or a conference that he\'s borrowed wisdom from he is a lifelong student and committed to his field of study. Beyond that, he is relatable. Cameron is a real, downtoearth, intelligent and interested person with a sense of humor, who is gentle and kind. The Well Clinic on Potrero Hill is a lovely, beautiful space that invites soothing and calm. It feels like it should like you are going to a place that is going to attend to your needs and where you are giving yourself attention you deserve.I couldn\'t recommend Cameron or The Well more highly, and sincerely feel that it was Cameron who buoyed me through one of the hardest periods of my life. I feel grateful to still have him in my life on the other side.'),(4262,311,5,'I truly recommend The Well Clinic. Alex Momtchiloff is a deeply insightful couples therapist. He has an assuring and powerful presence combined with the kind of intelligence that is really needed for this kind of work. He is able to point things out that I believe others would miss...or choose to miss at least. He has an ability to do this without being intrusive.The clinic itself is inviting and professional. I have never seen a counseling center quite like this one. In fact, it doesn\'t really feel like a therapy clinic at all  there is a midcentury vibe mixed in with a kind of, handcrafted touch which I find awesome. The Well Clinic\'s design makes me feel comfortable and at ease, which probably benefits the work I am doing.Alex is not the only couples therapist there...I have heard from friends that there are quite a few good ones. I would imagine his schedule is often full, but ask for him first.'),(4263,311,2,'Pretty Sure This Wasn\'t A Corrective Experience, orHow I Was Dumped By Cameron YarbroughAnd Learned It Was All My FaultI was a client of Cameron Yarbrough\'s for a year and a 12, and, I sensed, a frustrating client.He said, I don\'t feel effective! several timeswith the exclamation point.Two weeks ago I asked Cameron if he wanted to continue therapy.He reassured me that he did. Thursday I began the session with, I wasn\'t going to come back but you looked sad. I had a difficult longterm issue. For a few days I considered leaving therapy to free me of itwhich of course it wouldn\'t.Cameron\'s whole demeanor changed, he became extremely alert, I didn\'t know you wanted to leave.That\'s because I don\'t.I was confused. I was referring to a feeling from last week, not now.His toneexpression threw me.I could see he wanted to take my remark as an intent to terminate.Cameron didn\'t ask questions.He didn\'t ask why I had felt like not coming back.He didn\'t ask what I meant by ...but you looked sad.We didn\'t discuss my feelings or thoughts at all.I said, I was, I am..., confused.He started ending it.Listening to him was surreal. I slipped back into feeling that leaving therapy would free me of pain. Talking about it would have helped; therapy triggered emotional flashbacks that felt like being lost in an undertow.Cameron shared his impressions of me: you\'re so critical and defensive, you scrutinize my words, you don\'t know how to relate to me, you flatten me out\'you statements\'; \'I statements\' ugly brotherand, clearly hurt, you said it his caring was fake!Cameron is very proud of his caring huge part of his idealized self so I had profoundly offended him.He offered 3 sessions to wrap it up.My head was spinning and I said no. I can\'t make funeral plans when I haven\'t processed the death.I was literally born to rejection; going along while Cameron led me out the door came naturally.I followed his lead. I felt hopeless.That was it. I left.I was up all night. At 5 am I sent a text saying:That was disorienting...Last week I felt depressed and like ending therapy, but had a change of heart. I had no plan to end therapy yesterday, but when I told you I had meant to last week you immediately started ending it yourself. I felt shown to the door. I accept it...just wanted you to know my experience.That last line was a mistake, I was confused and minimizing.But I was sure Cameron would respond and we\'d work it out.He didn\'t.I called and asked why.Cameron said that due to my last sentence he didn\'t think a response was required.disorienting...I had no plan to end therapy...I felt shown to the doorjust on a humane level, really? no response? After no reply to my text I knew Cameron wanted me gone.I felt so sad and stunned by my therapy abruptly ending that I requested those closure sessions even though I wanted to continue.Cameron, in a vm, again offered 3, that\'s what I think would work on my side now we have \'sides\'? but refused to see me at my regular appt because he had already scheduled something in my place. I texted the day after my session that I hadn\'t planned to end, and Cameron still gave my next appt away; the one I\'d had for a year and a 12.Maybe he hadn\'t, maybe he just said that, hoping that with all these hits I wouldn\'t return. It worked.Yesterday on the freeway I lost it. I pulled over and cried. I realized Cameron didn\'t know how devastated I was, so I left a message when I could talk, saying, I feel abandoned and traumatized. First time I ever let him hear me be that vulnerable.His vm in reply says, I can understand that it feels traumatizing to you...and yes, unfortunately I can\'t meet this week...He reiterated that it had to be next Thursday 9 days away and that he understood how destabilizing this ending was for me. No offer of a phone or Skype session.So he knew how devastated I was.Yes, it\'s destabilizing that you jumped on one sentence I began a session with to terminate my therapy.It\'s destabilizing that you didn\'t ask questions; you just took it and ran.It\'s destabilizing that you heard how upset I am and still refuse to see me for 9 days.It\'s destabilizing that you viewed my \'no plan to end\' text as not requiring a response and were satisfied to let that be our final communication.I feel like I\'ve been hit by a truck. A manipulative truck.When we spoke on the phone,Cameron quoted me from our last session, I wasn\'t going to come back... and said to him it meant I wanted to end. I said emphatically, I do not want to end my therapy. Do you want to end it?There was a pause, then very coldly, I don\'t know. In one session Cameron reassured me he wanted to continue and in the very next he does this. tl;dr went to Cameron for trauma and got it'),(4264,311,5,'I\'ve been coming to The Well since spring of this year. First to see Cameron in couples counseling I wrote a separate review of his practice, and currently for a women\'s selfawareness group led by Jyoti Rao pacificpsychotherapy.co. I immediately feel a sense of calm when I enter The Well. The place is furnished in midcentury decor, beautiful and simple. I wish my house was as clean and inviting. The art is contemporary, interesting, thoughtinvoking and seems to have seasonal turnover to keep things fresh. There is a cooler of water and hot tea in the waiting area. A white noise machine hums in the background so it doesn\'t feel too quiet or sterile.... or maybe that\'s to cover up any crying going on in the therapists\' rooms.There are bike racks in the building so you don\'t have to worry about whether it\'s getting stolen outside, although occasionally all the racks are used so you gotta lock it to an outside pole, but I\'ve never had any incidents doing so.Added bonus is that Whole Foods is across the street, so I can easily treat myself to some chocolate after my session.'),(4265,311,5,'I highly recommend the Well Clinic for couples and personal counseling. I have been going to see Maya for about one year now and she has greatly improved my relationship with my partner as well as personally helped me grow and understand some of the obstacles I have encountered in my life.'),(4266,311,5,'This place is awesome! I met with Harry, the M.D., about nutrition and really felt a connection that was in line with my philosophy. He was an excellent communicator, and really listened to my specific needs and then tailored a follow up meeting to execute our plan. The Well Clinic is an amazing place for holistic healing and medicine. The services they offer and the professionals they employ are unparalleled. They are a progressive, forward thinking bunch of healers who will make you feel at home. When people ask me for healthmental healthacupuncture referrals, I always steer them to the Well because I know they will get the best treatment. The offices are super niceswanky, and they are very organized, which is a huge plus when scheduling conflicts arise. Huge thumbs up for this awesome team!!'),(4267,311,5,'I\'ve been going to Cameron since 2007. He\'s easily the best therapist I\'ve ever seen, and I\'ve seen my share. I remember, in my first visit, I immediately felt comfortable opening up to him. I could just sense a genuine sense of compassion in him. In that first session he quickly had me touching on some deepseated and painful emotional issues. It just happened very naturally, and while it was difficult, I was grateful for the experience. Another great thing about Cameron is his directness and honesty. He doesn\'t b.s. me and will call me out on my own b.s. if and when it comes up probably often. He\'s just a good, downtoearth person who is easy to talk to. The last thing I\'ll say is that he\'s also introduced me to a variety of resources outside of therapy, which have been immeasurably helpful to me in my life.'),(4268,311,5,'We have received great consultation from Cameron. He has been very helpful in helping us zoom out and see the big picture. Counseling with Cameron has helped us reprioritize our time and establish new goals. We are a married couple running a business together so it is really important that we have excellent communication. Our sessions with Cameron have really helped us move the ball forward. My husband and I are feeling so much more optimistic and even excited about the track we are on now. His style is very direct...something we both like a lot. This guy is not your average therapist, he will push you in positive ways, ask difficult questions, and hold both partners accountable. We are so happy to have him.'),(4269,311,5,'I began to see Lexi Frank at The Well at a particularly challenging time for me personally and professionally. Her holistic approach and style has helped drive a shift in my life in the most positive and wonderful ways. The Well offers a very comforting, clean and welcoming space. I have come to believe therapy can be a critical component to your emotional health as regular workouts are to physical health. I highly recommend The Well for anyone who is ready to start or restart that emotional workout and journey.'),(4270,311,5,'The Well Clinic is fantastic. Comfortable setting and acupuncture is awesome. I strongly recommend to anyone!'),(4271,311,5,'Cameron is an excellent therapist. I feel like he understands my relationship on a deeper level than even my husband and I do. He gave us practical communication tools that really helped us resolve some of our conflict. We have had sessions with Cameron at two points in our relationship. He helped us a few years ago and he was so effective that my partner and I have since gotten married and had a beautiful baby together. When we sought Cameron\'s help again, he remembered everything we had worked on in our earlier sessions. He is honest and straightforward and is certainly not the type of therapist that just sits and passively listens. He is so tuned into my husband and I that he is able to provide great advice which we can implement in our relationship on a daily basis. If you are looking to win an argument or get someone to be on your side of an argument, Cameron is not your man. He is not about picking sides, but rather works to help you understand your partner on a deeper level. Cameron is the type of therapist that always lets you leave feeling better and with constructive things you can do to improve your relationship. I would highly recommend him to any couple! Cameron is worth every penny!'),(4272,311,5,'The time had come to find a couples therapist.. my husband and I wanted to work on our communication issues.. I really did not know how to go about finding a therapist, combined with the challenge of finding one that we could both relate too. I decided to look on yelp, we met with Cameron once and both new that we had found someone we wanted to work with. And our first instincts were correctCameron really listens.. he remembers what you have said and talked about even from sessions a while ago... he is compassionate and understanding.. and very intelligent.. We are able to utilize what we have learned in our sessions, and still continue to do so. My husband is out of town a lot so it has made it difficult to be consistent with our sessions, and Cameron has been super accommodating with our challenging schedule.His new office is beautiful. I really appreciate that he values all healing modalities and incorporates an integrated approach in the office space that encouraging physical well being as well as emotional. We feel very fortunate to have found Cameron!'),(4273,311,5,'I came here for couples counseling and was totally impressed with this place. I\'m not exactly the couples therapy type so I was skeptical about the process. The Well Clinic doesn\'t feel like a therapy center or a traditional sterile doctor\'s office. They did a great job of creating a hip and artistic vibe which cooled off any fear of being analyzed I may have had coming in. I definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a younger and more innovative culture. My only criticism was that parking during the day was really difficult. Give yourself enough time to circle for parking or pay $9 for the parking garage across the street.'),(4274,311,5,'I found Cameron while he was finishing up his degree. We were paired randomly, but boy was it fortuitous. I didn\'t see him for couples counseling, but on my ownthough it was regarding to a crashed relationship... and then some!Long story short, Cameron is excellent at what he does. I spent about a year and a half with him during probably the darkest time in my life and he really helped see me through it. And helped me turn my life around.I\'ve worked with 34 therapists at various times in my life, and never have I jelled with any as well as Cameron. He is very kind and compassionate; non judgmental. He never once tried to tell me what I should or shouldn\'t do, nor how I should or shouldn\'t feel. He just listened and helped me explore my feelings. And explore the reality of life, relationships, and the stories we tell ourselves.Cameron brings an eastern philosophy to his work that I really appreciate. He is very compassionate, patient, empathetic, and has a deep caring for his patientsclients. He doesn\'t sit on a chair next to the couch like we imagine from the movies, but is actively engaged in each session the way a close friend would be. Totally present.Thanks Cameron.To everyone: You\'ll get the most out of any therapist by going in open minded and ready to grow. Resistance is your worst enemy.'),(4275,311,5,'I know Cameron, who runs the clinic, and Jonah, who gave me acupuncture for a sore knee: two of the nicest guys around. It\'s a very clean, quiet, pleasant office, and the staff is friendly, professional, and efficient. Also a good location for me my office is over on Bryant and Mariposa. Parking can be a challenge, but hey, it\'s SF.'),(4276,311,5,'I have worked with two counselors at The Well Clinic and have been really happy with the results. I found Cameron to be a very effective and positive couple\'s therapist, and I would not hesitate to recommend him. We worked with him intensively a few years ago to address a few issues that arose in our family. We are not able to make it to the Bay Area frequently so we often worked with him by phone or video though I am not sure that is a service he offers regularly. Cameron listened attentively, developed a thorough understanding of the dynamics, and offered very specific suggestions and tools that we could use to improve our relationships. I really appreciated his insight, empathy, and his expertise and skill at explaining to me the human motivations, emotions, and reactions that had precipitated the situation we were in. It actually only took a few sessions for us to move our relationship forward. Cameron also recommended I work with their staff acupuncturist Jonah. Wow, what a great call. He literally brought me from a place of being in so much pain that I had a hard time driving a car to surfing big waves again in less than three weeks. In retrospect the physical pain that I was in was connected to the emotional struggles that I was navigating, since a lot of my stress was manifesting in my neck in addition to bad fall at the skate park. I truly believe that it was the integrated approach taken at the Well Clinic that supported me to move forward in my life physically and emotionally. Based on plenty of previous experiences with counselors, and physiatrists, and acupuncturists, I truly recommend The Well Clinic.'),(4277,311,5,'I cannot recommend Cameron\'s skill enough. His ability to help guide you to be your own guide and come away with your own fresh insights that sheds a new reality on your experience is remarkable. I\'ve been to a few different cognitive behavior therapists in my time, all were supportive, but in terms of more penetrating insight that sticks and helps soften and break down the confusion and suffering, he\'s simply been entirely trustworthy, incisive, and excellent. We are truly lucky to have him in SF.'),(4278,311,5,'I love going to the Well Clinic. I have seen both Cameron Yarborough and Harry McIlroy there and it is always a joy to be in the space. There are comfy couches, tea, good reading material and I always feel a general sense of wellness and ease when I go there. The therapists are experienced, reliable, and have the utmost integrity. If you are looking for a therapist check this clinic out.'),(4279,311,5,'I\'ve already reviewed my individual therapist. And now he\'s a part of this Well Clinic which is just very cool. I like the concept of having all of these treatments available in one place, a whole bunch of people devoted to health on the same wavelength. I feel calmer and less stressed just walking in there. The Well Clinic space is modern and uncluttered with fantastic artwork on the walls. I wanted to buy at least two pieces I saw, oh money tree where are you? So, yes, the Well Clinic is different than any other therapists\' offices I\'ve been to um, let\'s not talk about how many I\'ve seen over the years, okay? I\'ve moved a couple times... um, what else does that say about me?... I\'m working on it, alright?! Don\'t judge! But I can say this one is the best designed by far, if you notice that stuff. I\'ve also now been to Courtney twice for a massage. Where do I start with how good she is? She does this Intuitive massage, which is different than other massages I\'ve had. It\'s like massage with energy work. I literally could feel the warmth and energy radiating from her hands! Courtney could even feel where I was having pain in my leg without me even telling her I had forgotten to mention it earlier and she asked me about it during our session. Her skill is like nothing I\'ve ever experienced. If I\'m not mistaken, even Courtney is a therapist, in addition to a massage therapist and it shows in her mannerisms and gentle demeanor. I\'m going to start seeing her on a regular basis to continue what we\'ve started. Amazing. LOVE the Well Clinic. And my calmer, more zenlike psyche and body thanks them. Maybe I\'ll try out the acupuncture next...'),(4280,311,5,'I have now worked with two different health care providers at The Well Clinic and have been very impressed. I have worked with Dr. McIlroy for a general nutrition consultation, and with Jonah Larkin for acupuncture. Both were a part of my larger effort to curb my anxiety related to work stress, and stay physically healthy as I plow into my 40\'s. I am not a big fan of antidepressants or antianxiety meds so I sought out The Well Clinic for a holistic program. They have been awesome.'),(4281,311,5,'Love this place!These guys really have a great thing going here. If your in need of a physical or mental tuneup, The Well is the place for you. I have had experience with both Jonah and Cameron, and I can tell you they are good solid people that know their stuff. The Well is a modern, clean place that immediately makes you feel at ease and comfortable. Both my daughter and my wife have seen Jonah for his acupuncture services and came away feeling great. You will be in good hands at The Well!'),(4282,311,5,'I have been seeing Cameron for a while now, and can say that he is a skilled and talented therapist. I have gotten a lot out of our relationship, would have heartily recommend Cameron to a friend and have!'),(4283,311,5,'I have been working with Cameron for several months now and I can\'t say enough about how much he has helped me. If I could give him 100 stars, I would. Cameron has such an innate sense of what the underlying issues are and can pinpoint a major theme or problem in such a short period of time. It\'s like he knows me better than I know myself sometimes. Cameron brings sincere empathy and compassion to our sessions and I really feel like we are trusted friends. He immediately made me feel comfortable and safe. I have been to several other therapists and have never felt the connection and comfort with them that I do with Cameron. I never feel diminished or talked down too and when he offers up a suggestion on what I might do in a circumstance, I never feel like he is pressuring me to take his advice. He is all about support. He has even helped me with career coaching and connected me with a wonderful mediation coach. Cameron is truly amazing and we are so lucky to have him and The Well in San Francisco.'),(4284,311,5,'I can not express how impressed I was with Maya Johansson at the Well Clinic. I didn\'t really know what to expect but found it a nonjudgmental and life changing experience.One thing in particular that I admired was the fact that there was a beginning, middle and an end to what we were working on. I had been a bit nervous that it was something that would go on forever . Obviously you never stop working on yourself and your relationships but it was nice to be given the tools to do it on my own.I could go on forever about how great Maya is.');

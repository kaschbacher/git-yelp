# Guide to Yelp Project IPYNB Files

PART I: Get and store the data

1.  YelpAPI - pulls businesses for orthopedists and populates the business table for mysql
2.  Extract_Reviews - loads from mysql business to obtain yelp_id, then scrapes reviews 
    from each doctor's site.  Stores pickled dataframe objects for ortho_business 
    and ortho_reviews
3.  Reviews_toMySQL - loads the pickled ortho_reviews DF and uses iterrows to input each 
    row into the ortho.review mysql database.  Note, tried SQLAlchemy and df-to-sql but 
    couldn't get those to work.
    
*** 300 orthopedists in business table and 13081 reviews  (all SF area)


PART II:  Analyze the data with LDA

4.  NLP-All-Reviews_LDA - to analyze the data and pickle the final lda object

# Guide to Yelp Project IPYNB Files

PART I: Get and store the data

1.  YelpAPI - pulls businesses for orthopedists and populates the business table for mysql
2.  Extract_Reviews - loads from mysql business to obtain yelp_id, then scrapes reviews 
    from each doctor's site.  Stores pickled dataframe objects for ortho_business 
    and ortho_reviews
3.  Reviews_toMySQL - loads the pickled ortho_reviews DF and uses iterrows to input each 
    row into the ortho.review mysql database.  Note, tried SQLAlchemy and df-to-sql but 
    couldn't get those to work.


PART II:  Analyze the data with LDA

4.  NLP-All-Reviews_LDA - to analyze the data and pickle the final lda object
5.  Representative_reviews -  Call up reviews most representative for a given topic
6.  LDA_Apply - Apply the LDA model to a new review you haven't seen before (for validation)



PART III:  VISUAL GRAPHICS & VALIDATION

1.  MySQL_Import - graphs business stars by reviews with sns
2.  Display_vis_data - display the interactive visualization of lda
3.  PCA_plot - use PCA to reduce the topic space dimensionality and plot it by stars
